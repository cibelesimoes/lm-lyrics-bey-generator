verse 1: bienvenue là où l\\'fort tue le faible, où la faim tue de fait où la société t\\'congratule, et t\\'accepte une fois la fortune faite, où les dettes cumulent, où l\\'crédit accule, des tas d\\'foyers, où les hommes en perte d\\'idéaux, jurent qu\\'par les putes dévoyées en vidéo, chaque soir c\\'est la fête, les salons cossus attirent les fesses, sur les gros caïds, qui arrosent les guéridons de pure cocaïne, ici, les gosses rêvent d\\'êt\\'pirès, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent, nombreux sont ceux qui dès 13 ans connaissent leur première ivresse, bienvenue là où l\\'air pollué, par les pots d\\'échappement déclenchent allergies en cascade, et taux record d\\'o3 dans les bronches, douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d\\'dangereux qu\\'la faune humaine quand ils explosent un fourgon brinks sans peine au tri-nitro-toluène, les vices connus gênent la machine de l\\'etat, les cabinets changent laissent la merde en état, peu passent les menottes en métal, on en est là ici 300 blindés font c\\'qui veulent, font comme s\\'ils vivent seuls ramènent tout à leur p\\'tite gueule, quand mille meurent fauchés dans l\\'viseur bienvenue, après le 11 septembre on évoque une aut\\'voie au silence : dis au revoir, l\\'enculeur d\\'aut\\'fois, dit baiser le monde à haute voix où les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les mômes de bangkok pourquoi donc mettre à part ces connards en taule ici on croit moins en dieu qu\\'aux fantômes, un hymne sanguinaire on entonne, partout on sent la peur d\\'un peuple passé au pantone l\\'hiver mange l\\'été, et l\\'printemps parfois tue l\\'automne, crie plus fort, les grands de c\\'monde, ont égaré quelque part leur sonotone bienvenue, mes p\\'tits anges car voici c\\'monde beyoncé - chorus: welcome to a

bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on te le dit qu\\'20 ans après. parce qu\\'en fait ils s\\'en tapent de c\\' qu\\'on pense on l\\'sait mais ils le diront jamais. où on est trop con pour voir

can have ambition, but not too much you should aim to be successful, but not too successful otherwise, you will threaten the man because i am female, i am expected to aspire to marriage i am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don\\'t teach boys the same? we raise girls to see each other as competitors not for jobs or for accomplishments, which i think can be a good thing but for the attention of men we teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are feminist: a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes you wake up, flawless post up, flawless ridin\\' round

is it the bar i set? my arms, i stretch, but i can’t reach a far cry from it, or it\\'s in my grasp, but as soon as i grab, squeeze i lose my grip like the flying trapeze into the dark, i plummet now the sky\\'s blackening, i know the mark’s high butterflies rip apart my stomach knowing that no matter what bars i come with you\\'re gonna harp, gripe, and that\\'s a hard vicodin to swallow so i scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis i feel the ice cracking, because i walk on water but i ain\\'t no jesus i walk on water (shit) but only when it freezes it\\'s the curse of the standard that the first of the mathers disc set always in search of the verse that i haven\\'t spit yet will this step just be another misstep to tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect i\\'ve garnered? the rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless and it always feels like i\\'m hitting the mark ’til i go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart like: this shit is garbage god’s given me all this still i feel no different regardless kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded if only they knew, it\\'s a facade and it’s exhaustive and i try to not listen to nonsense but if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence mission accomplished i\\'m not god-sent nas, rakim, pac, b.i.g., james todd smith, and i\\'m not prince, so i walk on water but i ain\\'t no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes ’cause i\\'m only human, just like you making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew i don\\'t think you should believe in me the way that you do \\'cause i\\'m terrified to let you down, oh it\\'s true, i\\'m a rubik\\'s, a beautiful mess at times juvenile, yes, i goof and i jest a flawed human, i guess but i\\'m doing my best to not ruin your expectations and meet \\'em, but first, the speedom verse now, big sean, he\\'s going too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom? there was a time i had the world by the balls, eating out my palm every album, song i was spazzin\\' the fuck out on and now i\\'m getting clowned and frowned on but the only one who\\'s looking down on me that matters now\\'s deshaun am i lucky to be around this long? begs the question, though especially after the methadone as yesterday fades and the dresden home is burnt to the ground and all that\\'s left of my house is lawn the crowds are gone and it\\'s time to wash out the blonde sales decline, the curtains drawn they\\'re closing the set, i\\'m still poking my head from out behind and everyone who has doubt, remind now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times now let \\'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes and as i grow outta sight, outta mind, i might go outta mine \\'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight when i made a fuckin\\' tightrope outta twine? but when i do fall from these heights, though, i\\'ll be fine i won\\'t pout or cry or spiral down or whine but i\\'ll decide if it\\'s my final bow this time around \\'cause i walk on water but i ain\\'t no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes \\'cause i\\'m only human, just like you i\\'ve been making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew i don\\'t think you should believe in me the way that you do \\'cause i\\'m terrified to let you down, oh if i walked on water, i would drown \\'cause i\\'m just a man, but as long as i got a mic i\\'m godlike so me and you are not alike bitch, i wrote stan     [nala] your reign is over, scar if you wanna get him, you have to get through us are you with me, lions?
