Título,Letra
'03 Bonnie & Clyde (feat. Jay-Z)," 
Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (one more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

1+1," 
If I ain't got nothing
I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know
One plus one equals two
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through
'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby
Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all
Right now, baby
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me
Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
I don't know much about fighting but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist I realize
I'm lying right next to you
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us, ooh
Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me

A Woman Like Me," 
Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me?
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no no
Do you think
That I could be the girl of your dreams
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes I'm just out of control
You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too, deep up in it (too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me (woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it (no no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Do you think
That I could be the one that you seek
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby I don't mind
Do you think
That I can make you real happy baby
Just don't get me wrong
My loving is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on
You need to stop for a minute (no no)
Before you get too, deep up in it (no no)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems (seems)
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me (woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it (without it)
Can't believe everything you see

You need to stop for a minute (stop for a minute)
Before you get too, deep up in it (before you get too deep up in it)

After All Is Said And Done," 
Here I am
Looking in the mirror
An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer
I can see the sun
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh
There you are
Always strong when I need you
You let me give
And now I live, fearless and protected
With the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done
I once believed that hearts were made to bleed
(Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, ohbaby)
But now I'm not afraid to say
I need you, I need you so stay with me
These precious (precious) hours (yeah)
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow
Where there's only love
After all is, all is said and done
(Yeah baby) Oh baby
(Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed)
(I'll never)
I'll never be afraid to say
I need you, I need you, so here
Here we are in the still of this moment
Fear is gone, hope lives on
We found our happy ending
For there's only love (only love)
And this sweet, sweet love
After all is, all is said and done
Yeah baby after all is (all is)
All is said and done

Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing (feat. Justin Timberlake),"

Like the real thing 
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing 
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
I see your picture
Hanging on the wall
But it can't sing 
Or come to me
When I call your name
I realize it's just
A picture in a frame
And I read your letters
When you're not here
They don't move me
They don't groove me
Like when I hear 
Your sweet voice
Whispering in my ear
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing 
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
No other sound is quite 
The same as your name
No touch can do 
Half as much
To make me feel better
Let's stay together
Together, baby 
Together, yeah
Together, together
I got some memories 
To look back on
And though they help 
When you phone
I'm well aware 
Nothing takes
The place 
Of your being there
There ain't nothing
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing 
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing

There ain't nothing

All I Could do Was Cry," 
I heard church bells ringing
I heard a choir singing
I saw my love 
Walk down the aisle
On her finger, he placed a ring
Ooh, oh
I saw them holding hands
She was standing there 
With my man
I heard them promise 
'Til death do us apart
Each word was a pain 
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry
And now
The wedding is over
The rice, rice has been thrown 
Over their heads
For them, life has just begun
But mine is ending
Oh- oh, all I could do
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry

My horoscope said I'm really out my noodle
I'm troublin', I'm puzzlin', it's Sudoku
Say, Bey, yes, America got a problem
Geeked up, choosy lover that chose violence
Universal, please, don't play possum

Truthfully, I be lyin' in my rap song
'Cause I always fail to mention I'll slap homie
His career didn't come with no life insurance
Hope his day-one fans got some facts on 'em
I'm an honorary BeyHive, let's see why
Them diamonds don't be fly, they all CGI
You better get it off your chest like breast reduction
If she stressed over you, she stressed for nothin'
Hold up, wait a minute

Amor Gitano," 
Ay
Gitana
Ooooooh
Ven y quédate conmigo
Dame el corazón
Vida mía estoy murriendo
Lento en mi prisión
Anda, dime lo que sientes
Quítate el pudor
Y deja de sufrir
Escapa con mi amor
Después te llevaré hasta a dónde quieras
Sin temor y sin fronteras
Hasta dónde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya sé a donde voy
Soy tu gitano
Tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana
Tu compañera
La que te sigue
La que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Esta guerra la ha ganado
Nuestro amor
Yo nací para tus ojos
Para nadie mas
Siempre voy a estar en tu camino
Alma de mi alma
Corazón de tempestad
Dime por dónde ir
Después te llevaré hasta a dónde quieras
Sin temor y sin fronteras
Hasta dónde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya sé a dónde voy
Soy tu gitano
Tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana
Tu companiera
La que te sigue
La que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado
Nuestro amor
Nuestro amor

At Last," 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Ohh yeah yeah
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Ohh yeah yeah…
You smile, you smile
oh And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

Ave Maria," 
She was lost
In so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
But for the grace of God, though, I
You are my heaven on Earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
I've been alone
While I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home
Knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
You are my heaven on Earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing, Ave Maria
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands
Baby you've got to understand
You are my heaven on Earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria, Ave Maria

Back To Black (feat. Andre 3000)," 
I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with his same old safe bet
You and your head high
And your tears dry, get on without your guy
I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And you tread a troubled track
Your odds are stacked, you'll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
I go back to her
And you go back to
You go back to
I love you much
It's not enough, I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times

Everybody knows that face
Even with her head low, they still know that shape
When she come through the club people take they place
Chicks throwin handcuffs
'Cause they knowin that they man ain't safe
'Cause she the one switchin up flows
If it's 4 door, 2 gotta go
Chicks like: What kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin like: Please get low

Everybody can't do this
Some ain't gotta clue til they hear me spit
Ah chu I spew 'cause yo girl is sick
Is it the change or the hips you can't tell, but you know it's thick
'Cause she the one switchin up flows
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go
Chicks like: What kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin like: Please get low

For this type of girl it's not that hard
You see her 'cause she's too far gone
They only prayin, pray for her downfall
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin what it do fit to be a plus
Hey

Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance
You need to understand that balance
And respect all the creatures
From the crawling ant
To the leaping antelope
We are all connected in the great circle of life

Believe," 
Children sleeping, snow is softly falling
Dreams are calling like bells in the distance
We were dreamers not so long ago
But one by one we all had to grow up
When it seems the magic's slipped away
We find it all again on Christmas day
Believe in what your heart is saying
Hear the melody that's playing
There's no time to waste
There's so much to celebrate
Believe in what you feel inside
And give your dreams the wings to fly
You have everything you need
If you just believe
Trains move quickly to their journey's end
Destinations are where we begin again
Ships go sailing far across the sea
Trusting starlight to get where they need to be
When it seems that we have lost our way
We find ourselves again on Christmas day
Believe in what your heart is saying
Hear the melody that's playing
There's no time to waste
There's so much to celebrate
Believe in what you feel inside
And give your dreams the wings to fly
You have everything you need
If you just believe [x4]
Just believe

Ay, no nos va a engañar
Ay, no terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
No nos va a dividir
No nos va a incitar
No vamos a sufrir
Por un bello embustero
Confiaba en él más, cuando lo encontré besándote el cuello
(Pero el no lo podía creer, las dos caímos en su red)
¿Por qué a ti si hay mil por ahí? Él es un perro
(Las dos, sin querer, caímos presas en su piel)
A mí también
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez más
Ay, no nos pelearemos
Ay, no nos va a engañar
Ay, no terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
No nos va a dividir
No nos va a incitar
No vamos a sufrir

Lo creía tan mío, yo vivía por él
Fuimos un desafío que pudo más que él
Es un hombre muy frío, no es de una mujer

Bienvenue (feat. IAM)," 
Beyoncé - Intro:
Beyonce
IAM
Welcome
Welcome
Hey
Ohhhh
Beyoncé - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face
Just to get it done.
Welcome to the human race
Where if you ain't got money, then you'll pay in pain
Welcome to this world of ours
And if you had the chance would you come back again ?
Cause now you're here there ain't no turning back,
You got tears in your eyes
And the monkey on your back (?)*
Akhenaton - Verse 1:
Bienvenue là où l'fort tue le faible, où la faim tue de fait
Où la société t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite,
Où les dettes cumulent, où l'crédit accule, des tas d'foyers,
Où les hommes en perte d'idéaux, jurent qu'par les putes dévoyées en vidéo,
Chaque soir c'est la fête, les salons cossus attirent les fesses,
Sur les gros caïds, qui arrosent les guéridons de pure cocaïne,
Ici, les gosses rêvent d'êt'Pirès, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent,
Nombreux sont ceux qui dès 13 ans connaissent leur première ivresse,
Bienvenue là où l'air pollué, par les pots d'échappement déclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches,
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Toluène,
Les vices connus gênent la machine de l'Etat, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en état, peu passent les menottes en métal, on en est là
Ici 300 blindés font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramènent tout à leur p'tite gueule, quand mille meurent fauchés dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, après le 11 septembre on évoque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde à haute voix
Où les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les mômes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre à part ces connards en taule
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fantômes, un hymne sanguinaire
On entonne, partout on sent la peur d'un peuple passé au pantone
L'hiver mange l'été, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne,
Crie Plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont égaré quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde
Beyoncé - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face

We all have a purpose in this world
We have to believe that we belong
Can't forget where we came from
We came from love.
Shurik'n - Verse 2:
Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tantôt l'un tantôt l'autre.
Ange et démon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent.
Où l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement quand elle frappe à nos portes.
Où la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup de surin dans l'aorte.
Où tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on te le dit qu'20 ans après.
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils le diront jamais.
Où on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon bien avant qu'il meure
Puis on se vante de le connaître achetant ses tableaux visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde où on se dit tous égaux blague à part là
L'caniveau là haut c'est les bureaux mais le mieux c'est au milieu
Où on se sait si fragile qu'on prévoit les pièces d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achètera des jambes en famille le dimanche
Où tout le monde ne mange pas à sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Créer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne à ses fins
La misère comme moyen où le supposé mort esclavage sévit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois ! Il y a toujours des grains de poussière vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas à Gattaca mais presque où seul l'élu évite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse se manifeste,
Où on parle présélection, d'amélioration, transformation
Génétique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de super soldats de plomb
Où on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
Où on entend le mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envolée la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'préfèrerais qu'tu le découvre,
Allez petit ! Lance toi t'inquiète fonce ! Moi, j'te couvre
Beyoncé - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face
Just to get it done.
Welcome to the human race
Where if you ain't got money, then you'll pay in pain
Welcome to this world of ours

BIGGER," 
If you feel insignificant, you better think again
Better wake up because you're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah‚ you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no
Understand the truth 'bout that question in your soul
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright‚ they hid that in the fine print
Uh, take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (rise), the spirit is teachin'
Oh‚ I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice
Let mama let you know (let you know)
Mama's just tryin', I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it, I had to say that thing twice
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I will fight, so I fight
If you feelin' frustrated and (oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (oh)
Forgiveness is key because we're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah, we're part of something way bigger
Bigger, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
Legacy, oh, you're part of something way bigger
Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary, you just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than me
Bigger than the picture they framed us to be, yeah
Ooh, ooh, you're part of something way bigger
Understand the truth 'bout that question in your soul (bigger)
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold (bigger)
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise, the spirit is teachin'
Oh, I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice

Bigger (feat. RAYE)," 
If you feel insignificant, you better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah‚ you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
Even now‚ we see it
And it ain't no secret, no
Understand the truth 'bout that question in your soul
Look up, don't look down‚ then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh, take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (rise) ‚ the spirit is teachin'
Oh, I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice
Let mama let you know (let you know)
Mama's just tryin', I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it, I had to say that thing twice
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I will fight, so I fight
If you feelin' frustrated and (oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah, we're part of something way bigger
Bigger, you're part of something way better
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
Legacy, oh, you're part of something way bigger
Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary, you just don't know it
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to be, yeah
Oh, oh, you're part of something way bigger
Understand the truth 'bou
T that question in your soul (bigger)
Look up, don't look down
Then watch the answers unfold (bigger)
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise, the spirit is teachin'
Oh, I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice
If you feel insignificant, you better think again
Better wake up 'cause you're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
I'll be the roots, you be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah, we're part of something way bigger

"Bills, Bills, Bills"," 
At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about
[Chorus:]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Now you've been maxing out my card (card)
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But instead you're headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees perpetrating
Telling your friends that you be ballin'
And then you use my cell phone (phone)
Callin' whoever that you think's at home
And then when the bill comes
All of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about
[Repeat Chorus]
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another

Bohemian Rhapsody," 
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me

He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Bismillah! We will not let you go (let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (let him go!)

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye? (Yeah!)
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?

Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters

Hook up your seatbelt it's time for takeoff
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!
I'm about to break you off
H-town goin hard
Lead my hips, slap my thighs
Swing my hair, square my eyes
Lookin' hot, smellin' good
Groovin' like I'm from the hood
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this?
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
Move your body up and down (whoo!)
Make your booty touch the ground (whoo!)
I can't help but wonder why (whoo!)
Is my vibe to vibealacious for you, babe
I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip with my hip you slip into a trance
I'm hopin you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz
(Scatting)
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

Broken-hearted Girl," 
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me, how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl
There's something that I feel I need to say
But up 'till now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me
And still you in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you, but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you, baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without my babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

Remember the first day when I saw your face?
Remember the first day when you smiled at me?
You stepped to me, and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
Remember the first day when you called my house?
Remember the first day when you took me out?
We had butterflies although we tried to hide it
And we both had a beautiful night
The way we held each other's hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one
Ooh, oh, ooh
I know that he loves me, cause he told me so
I know that he loves me, cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me, if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul
Remember the first day, the first day we kissed?
Remember the first day we had an arguement?
We apologized, and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games?
Remember the first day you fell in love with me?
It felt so good for you to say those words
'Cause I felt the same way too
The way we held each other's hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt soo good to fall in love
And I knew right then and there you were the one, ooh, oh oh, woah
I know that he loves me, cause he told me so
I know that he loves me, cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me, if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul.
I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life
And baby now that you're a part of me
You showed me
Showed me the true meaning of love
(The true meaning of love)

She minds her business and winds her waist
Gold like 24k, okay?

Most things out of focus, view
But when you're in the room, they notice you (notice you)
'Cause you're beautiful
Yeah, you're beautiful
Them men, them gon' fall in love with you and all of your glory

Meet me where your heart and the highway runs tonight, tonight
Jump into these wheels of fire and together we'll ride, we'll ride
Somewhere where we've never been
Somewhere where a chance is taken on a dream
Somewhere where we can begin

Well somewhere in this mixed up and crazy world

Where people like us can be free to make our own mistakes
Get a break

To realize the brave new world we can create

Can I (feat. Drake)," 
Is it alright if I want to fall way
Way deep in love with you?
Would it be safe to say that I'm well on my way?
I'm scared as hell yeah
Know heartbreak oh too well yeah,
Just give me a green light baby
To say it's ok to go in, go in, go in,
Baby can I, yeah, baby can I, yeah
Baby can I, yeah, baby can I, can
I tear these damn walls down now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Can I tear these damn walls down now
Yeah yeah yeah, can I tear these damn walls down now?
I miss you do you miss us?
It's so much shit we gotta discuss
When you think about me do you get stuck?
Cause when I think about you everything just
Reminds me of when we had our first christmas
And I been thinking we should talk about mistrust
Cause it cuts and that hurts
If I could I would play it all backwards
If you say it then you can't take back words
My head pounds my back hurts
When your going no one ever really knows
But when your gone and you feeling really cold
Would that do exactly?
The same thoughts just keep coming at me
You attract me,
Would that be I'm not happy
Love is danger,
I never thought that I would share it with a stranger,
On a mission really thinking I could change up
And if I did was I ready for the change up
Would you listen to what she said and remain calm
But baby you left me filled with my anger
Mistake,
Went the wrong way
I'm preparing just to have another long day
Without you I go in
I get mad I throw things,
Temper tantrums I want you
We can do it all again and I want to what
Would that do exactly?
The same thoughts just keep coming at me
You attract me would that be
I'm not happy
I built these walls up they been here to protect me
Saying you're all I need now
I'm thinking bout you crazy
Cause the last time that I did this,
Damn near lost my mind
I can say that I can do this but really can I
Is it alright if I want to fall way
Way deep in love with you?
Would it be safe to say that I'm well on my way?
I'm scared as hell yeah,
Know heartbreak oh too well yeah,
Just give me a green light baby

Can You Feel The Love Tonight (feat. Childish Gambino)," 
I can see what's happening (I can't, what?)
And they don't have a clue (who's they?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trios down to two (oh, I get it)
The sweet caress of twilight (yeah)
There's magic everywhere (it's everywhere)
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air!
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings?
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings?
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed

Cards Never Lie," 
[Beyonce]
The card never lie my last breaths a sigh 
and now I think about if its my time to die
I dont know what I was thinking steady waisting
time with hill and i need to live my life because my time is
unforgiven I cant understand how my life changed around
manifest my destiny is it the brown on the ground
Blues sky are turning grey and its the point of  indecision
Beliveing in the cards is just a thing of tarot vision.
[Wyclef]
Girlfriend get your mind on line dont spend your time cause you
cant waist your time everyday like its your last but you mustfeed 
the mind intervention comes to snatch up all your dreams frombehind
love you feel it and you got to let him know it love your heartand thats 
the feeling that you go with if you have a dream you need to goand let
and show it cause you could wake up in the morning and it couldbe over
[Chorus]
No no no no 
I dont wanna I dont wanna  I dont wanna go

More to do than can ever be done
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round
It's the circle of life

Confessions," 
(verse 1)
The day you pissed me off
I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin and
I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me
if i needed a friend
he took me to his house and then he
invited me in...
then we sat on the couch
he put his arms around my waist
knowin i need lovin then he
gently grabbed my face
he kissed me like a guy could never
kiss a girl before
so you know what happened baby
i need to say no more
(chorus)
All this confessing
about some things i did
I might-as-well come clean
what you feel about that baby
All this confessing
bout the things i did
I might-as-well come clean
what you feel about that baby
All this guessing
are you through with me?
Cause I just came clean
what you feel about that baby
All this guessing
are you through with me?
Cause i just came clean
what you, feel about that...
(verse 2)
Remember the time you wondered
where your money went?
I called my friends
and bought some clothes
and took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a jeep
and we talked all the time
He asked me bout my man
and you know that i had to lie.
He thought i had no man
and i was chillin by my self
Don't get mad
cause i feel sad
thats why i must confess.
So many times i wanted to
let you know my dirt.
But everytime you said
you loved me i knew it would hurt.

(Bridge)
I was mad what was i to do
Never had any mind to
play on you
Look at all the hurt you put

The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strength to follow it through
I'm ready to change
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We're only find ourselves by loosing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control
I'm opening up
Show me a sign I can't believe
These crazy emotions flow through me
I'm gonna explode, oh
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, We can pretend
We're only find ourselves by loosing all

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath, you take me away

Daddy," 
I remember when you use to take me
On a bike ride everyday on the bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work
And I jumped in your arms when I saw you
(I was so excited)
I was so happy to see you
(So happy to see you)
Because you loved me I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory
And that's why
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date
And had a boyfriend (My first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said ""Beyoncé, I told you so""
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even mama said y'all would get one just like mine)
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory
That's why
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky, know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy
My unborn son to be like my daddy (thank you, you've done so much for me)
I want my husband to be like my daddy (I love you daddy)
There is no one else like my daddy (I get so emotional daddy, everytime I think of you)
And I thank you for loving me (I get so emotional daddy, everytime I think of you)
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else can replace my daddy

Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh
And daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
And daddy liked his whiskey with his tea
We rode motorcycles, blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said: Take care of your mother, watch out for your sister
That's when daddy looked at me
With his gun and his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the Bible
My daddy said: Shoot
Oh, my daddy: Said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said: Girl, it's your Second Amendment
Oh, oh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said: Remember
Oh, oh
He said: Take care of your mother, watch out for your sister
And that's when daddy looked at me
With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said: Shoot

With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the Bible
My daddy said: Shoot

Hey (oh, oh)
Hey, hey (Texas)
Oh (Texas)

I think, I think, I think, I think, whoa
This my song, this your song
Put your hands together now
They sound tired, but they don't sound Haggard
They got money, but they don't have Cash
They got Junior, but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said: Baby girl, he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said: Baby girl, he's playing you

Dance For You," 
I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true
Wanna show you how much you got you girl feeling good
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood
Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart
Show you, show you, show you till you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is
So you can never say how it used to be
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my baby, rocking, rocking on my baby
Swirling on my baby, swirling, swirling on my baby
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
Cause it's about to go down
You'll never need two cause I'll be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop-drop-drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the moonlight, for the power of love
And you know I'll never, ever, eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back
It's the pre game show
Daddy, you know what's up
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my baby, rocking, rocking on my baby
I'll be swirling on my baby, swirling, swirling on you baby
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
Cause it's about to go down
Imma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
When I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you baby, rocking, rocking on you baby
Swirling on you baby
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And the chance to make this love last
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my baby, rocking, rocking on my baby
I'll be swirling on my baby, swirling, swirling on you baby
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
Cause it's about to go down
Watch me pop it, pop it, pop-pop-pop-pop it for you baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you baby
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me throw it baby
Wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch
Watch me pop it, pop it, pop-pop-pop-pop it for you baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you baby
Watch me, me it, watch me, watch me throw it baby
Wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's déjà vu
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's h-o, light up the strobe
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tippin' like 4-4's
Like I'm from the h-o-u-s-t-o-n
Blow, wind so chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No déjà vu, just me and my, oh
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having déjà vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having déjà vu
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you

Destiny's Child Medley," 
You be sayin'
No no no no no
When it's really
Yes yes yes yes yes
(x 4)
Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Why don't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you ""What's the deal?""
You're holdin' it all inside
If you wanna' be with me
You gotta' keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you
Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care
Bug a boo(talk)
You buggin' what?
You buggin' Who?
You buggin' me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!
Any other day I would call
You would say, baby how's your day?
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah okay,
Could it be that you,
Are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your'one game
When you can not say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game

 "
Die With You," 
I don’t have a reason to cry
And I have every reason to smile
And I don’t have a reason to lie
When you’re already reading my mind
And I don’t have a reason to be, if I can’t be with you.
And I don't need air in my lungs
If I can’t sing your song
No I don’t need hands if I don’t get to keep you warm
And I don’t really need myself
If I will need you.
Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I could see with you
And I live so I can die with you.
And I don’t really need these fingers, if I don’t get to touch your spine.
Well I don’t need these legs, if I ain’t walking by your side
And I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you.
Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I could see with you
And I live, so I can die with you.
Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you.
I live so I can die with you

Disappear," 
If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight
Would it give me some light
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all
Are you drifting by?
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you I, can almost feel you
You\'re nearly here
And then you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If its good it\'s got to last
It feels so right
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You\'re nearly here
And then you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
I missed all the signs
One at a time you were ready
What did I know starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You\'re nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear

Dreaming," 
When I'm here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I don't care, I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on a star when a star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams
When I close my eyes
I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep
Knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe, no
(Without you, babe)
(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I ain't letting go
(I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe
(About you, babe)
So I'd rather be here dreaming
Than waking up with nobody home
If that's the only way to be with you
Then dreaming you is where I belong
I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be
'Cause when I close my eyes
I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep
Knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe, no

If this is a dream
Then I ain't letting go

'Cause everything I love is about you, babe
(About you, babe)
So I'd rather be here dreaming
Than waking up with nobody home
If that's the only way to be with you
Then dreaming you is where I belong
It took a lifetime just to get with you
To be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you, I'm gonna take it in
Breathe you in, yeah, yeah
And if I am dreaming
Let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you
Than be living life wthout me and you, you
(Let me know)
If this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know

Ego," 
Aw, baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut it right to the chase, huh
Some women were made
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you?
You feel me?
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? 
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gon' need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you're a sight to see, kinda something like me

Talking to the girl
She said: Know what, grow up, you nasty
I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg?
Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
It's on, baby, let's get lost

Emotion," 
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ooh yeah,
Verse 1
It's over and done, but the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to, instead of me tonight?
Bridge
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
Chorus
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion taking me over
caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me darling
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to hold on the time
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
Verse 2
I'm there at your side,
I'm part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You gotta go find your shining star
Repeat bridge
Repeat chorus
Good night
Repeat bridge
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions, taking me over
caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
(Don't you know I'm lost without you baby?)
But if you don't come back, come home to me darling
Nobody left in this world to hold on the time
(Nobody, nobody to hold me)
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
(Nobody to kiss me, yeah)
Goodnight
Goodnight

Ex-factor," 
It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me, who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way?
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay
Tell me, who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
[Hook]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin', It ain't workin' (No, it ain't workin')
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy (This is crazy, uh-huh!)
[Verse Two]
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself?
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See I know what we've got to do
You let go, and I'll let go too
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will
[Hook]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin', It ain't workin' (It ain't workin' !)
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy
Care for me, care for me!
I know you care for me!
There for me, there for me!
Said you'd be there for me!
Cry for me, cry for me!
You said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me!
Why won't you live for me?!

Family Feud (feat. Jay-Z)," 
My nigga got on
My nigga got all white, no socks

That's how he feel
Turn my vocal up
That's how you feel, Emory?
Turn my vocal up some more
Turn my vocal up, Guru!
Turn the music up too
Super Bowl goals
My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold
We in a whole different mode
Kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed
Oh, we gon' reach a billi' first
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh
Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
Pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, black-owned things
Hundred percent, black-owned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, huh
But we ain't get through to you yet, uh
What's better than one billionaire? Two (two)
'Specially if they're from the same hue as you
Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth
Hahahaha
I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin'
But that ain't even a statement
That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget
Wait, that ain't politically correct
Forget it
Can I get Amen from the congregation?
Amen, amen
Can I get a Amen from the congregation?
Amen, amen
Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me
Let me alone, Becky
A man that don't take care his family can't be rich
I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit
My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma, that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Can't losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby 'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
What's better than one billionaire? Two
I'll be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff got Cîroc
Y'all need to stop
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher

FIND YOUR WAY BACK,"

Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home with the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back
Daddy used to tell me: Look up at the stars
It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, but one day I might not make it
Circle of life, but one day I might not make it
But you just got to find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy

[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and whitout warning

Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box

And that's why I love you
Catch me when I fall
Accept my flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
Catch me when I fall
Accept my flaws and all
And that's why I love you

Forever To Bleed," 
You're all alone, and I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you
And wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you
But all I made you was lonely
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
I should've been there, I should've been there
I should've been there, I should've been there
All of the times you used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time, I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know you that were hurting
I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain
Another you I'll never find
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
I should've been there (ooO0Oo), I should've been there (ooO0Oo)
I should've been there (ooO0Oo), I should've been there (ooO0Oo)
I'm filled with regret, I'm gonna tip
And sew/soak myself in misery
Now in your life I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you
All by yourself and now I see
And I apologize for all the times
I left you home waiting for me
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music is for the sad men
Sing!
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and never
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young
So we livin' life like a video
Where the sun is always out
And you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by on the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up
On the hood of that pretty ass car
WIthout in a wrinkle in today
Because there is no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that lasts a whole lifetime
And it never ends because all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's stay in the moment
Smoke some week, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase
Neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut I'll be fine
I'm forever young
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and never
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, or never
Fear not when, fear not why
Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down
To generations while debating up in barber shops
Young slung, hung here
Show that the n-gga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, thats how you let me know, baby
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
Slamming Bentley doors
Hopping out of Porsches
Popping up on Forbes lists
Gorgeous
Hold up
N-ggas starting law suits
They be talking bullsh-t
I be talking more sh-t
They nauseous
Hold up
I'll be here forever

Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)
Take what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
'Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)

Do you slay? (slay) gon' slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
You slay (okay), okay (okay), I slay (okay), okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation (I slay)
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation (I slay)

Slay trick, or you get eliminated (I slay)
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation (I slay)

You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation
Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper

Hey baby, how you
Why your face lookin' all sad and blue
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you
Why you tryin' to act a fool
Don't try to say you seen me talking to your
girlfriends
Ask Tonya and Shirl then
Gimme a place and time when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doing
on the streets
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me
I'm just an average man
Tryin' to make it in this cold world
So tell me baby, why you trippin', girl
[Beyonce]
I don't wanna fuss with you
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me
Cause boy I am locking you out
I don't wanna hear a thing
Nothing you got to say
You should think twice
About the way you've been talking to me
Chorus
Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause there is no more us
Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause
[LeToya]
Ain't got no words for you
So you can stop callin' my friends
Tellin' them it wasn't your fault
And why I ain't letting you in
Too many times before
I let you back in my life
But this is a new day
And this won't go down tonight
Chorus
Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
Talking all that junk
Gonna pack my stuff
Is this what you want
I don't really care
Cause there is no more us
Better catch a cab

Introduced you to Dolce and Garbana
Advance you from the dirt bikes to Hondas
Took you from that terrible stress
Now you telling me that I am a bother
What kind of mess is that
To tell a man who put you on his team
That's just like killing a dream
(No no baby) That's how it seems
I worked hard to build up what I have for you
I pray to God, that there's not another man between me
and you
So just tell me
There's no need to lie folk
While you sittin' with your eyes closed
Do you wanna talk, aight yo
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Gift From Virgo," 
I wish i could look in your eyes
And tell you how i feel 
Right now inside
Baby i know that it's real
So real so real, so real
How i wish i could be with you
How i wish i wish i wish i could be with you right now
Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you
From your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me
Do you remember our first kiss
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time 
We spent those weeks together
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough
When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say good-bye
I never want to say good-bye
I never ever want to say good-bye
One day we'll make love
Finally i'll be yours
Only you only you 
I could love you
It's too late 
I already love you
I love you 
I love you
I love you
 "
God Bless The USA," 
If tomorrow all the things were gone
I´d worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
I'd thank my lucky stars, to be livin' here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an american
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of minnesota to the hills of tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every american heart
And it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an american
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
And I'm proud to be an american
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

God Made You Beautiful," 
When you were born
The angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath
And the world was right again
Tears were shed
How we have been blessed
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside
God made you beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
God made you beautiful
Beautiful
You're beautiful
Now look at me, you're brought into my life
I kiss those little feet and watch for your perfect smile
And wait it comes, the world's sight in your eyes
I felt love, I found peace of the purest kind
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside
God made you beautiful
Beautiful

God made you beautiful
You're beautiful

Grown Woman," 
I remember being young, tough, brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me, I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this
'Cause I put it down, like that, d-down like that
And I'm making all these racks, a-all these racks
And I'm moving round, like that, r-round like that
When I do it, I don't look back, d-don't look back
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk, 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, it's 'bout time I show it
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (whatever it is)
I'm a grown woman, and I know that I got it
I'm a grown woman, ain't got no room in my pockets
I'm a grown woman, look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
'Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat
Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl can get whatever she wants
That girl, she got that tight, that tight
Them boys, will do whatever she likes
(I'm a grown woman)
(I'm a grown)
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

Halo," 
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo, oh
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo (halo), halo
I can see your halo (halo), halo
I can feel your halo (halo), halo
I can see your halo (halo), halo, oh
Hit me like a ray of Sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more

The winner is
Beyonce Knowles female pop vocalist!
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love
I love you, Houston
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander: How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring

Have Your Way," 
I changed my life for you and all that you could do 
Is betray me, how could you play me 
You got me doing things I know I shouldn't do 
Am I crazy to live this way see I know I'm wrong, I'm shamed everyday 
We're not as one, but you think it's okay 
My life is not meant to be lived this way, this way 
You promised me one day we would be 
Husband and wife but it seems to me 
You're moving further away from me, from me Lord I'm trying to do what's pleasing in your sight 
But I'm in love, right now I'm caught up 
Instead of leaving, I know that you'll be right by my side 
And you'll make a way, just have your way I spent too much time playin wife on many nights 
Keepin you happy, giving you all of me 
I wake up every morning feeling guilty cause you're lying next to me 
Father forgive me, thought by now we'd be married Four months ago you promised me 
By now I'd have my wedding ring 
You've shown no committment to me, to me 
I cannot blame you for using me 
If I continue to let this be 
Cause shacking with a man just ain't me, ain't me Lord I'm trying to do what's pleasing in your sight 
But I'm in love, right now I'm caught up 
Instead of leaving, I know that you'll be right by my side 
And you'll make a way, just have your way

He Still Loves Me," 
[Walter]
Took me a while
But I'm finally here
I just wanna testify
Make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out
To be picked on
Talked about out my friends mouths
I've been beat down
Til he turned my life around
Turn my life around
Seems like I always fall short
Of bein worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
I aint no superstar
The spotlight aint shining on me
Cuz I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
[Beyonce]
I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
Cuz I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me
Everybody's got opinions
They ain't been in my position
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me
Seems like I always fall short
Of bein worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
[All]
I ain't no superstar
I wanna be for you
The spotlight ain't shining on me
Cuz I aint good enough
But He still loves me
I'm not perfect
(I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong
(yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best
(trying my best but)
But it aint good enough
(just aint good enough)
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cuz I aint good
But he still loves me
(I just aint good enough)
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do
Without out pain
Seems like I always fall short
Of bein worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
I ain't no superstar
(I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shining on me
Cuz I aint good enough
But You still love me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best but
(tryin my best)
It aint good enough
(I'm not good enough)
Shunned be the word
(shunned by the world)
If i dont succeed
(i dont succeed-ceed-ceed)
Cuz I aint good enough
But He still loves me
(child sing with me)
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best but
It aint good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the word
(Shunned by the world)
If i don't succeed
Cuz I ain't good enough
(I ain't good enough)
But He still loves me
(The Lord still loves me)
No I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
(Raise your hands if you understand)

 "
He's My Man," 
You say that he's wrong
You say that he's no good
Leave him alone cuz he's gonna hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps
Always runnin' the streets
He's playin the game
And he'll never love me
You say that he's fake but why does it feel so real
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I will always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what you hear it's all in the past
No matter what you feelin this love is gone last
The heart of his soul it breeds inside of me
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, I'm feelin so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
He's thugged out but he's my man
You say you don't trust him
Because he been locked up
You say that he trouble cuz he out in the strip club
But you were young once so you should understand
You say that you know
So you been a witness
You say it's foshow
Say he got a mistress
Until you can show me I'm gone stand by him
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I gon always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what you hear it is all in the past
No matter what you feelin this love is gone last
The heart of his soul it breeds inside of me
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, I'm feelin so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
He's thugged out but he's my man
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful

You got me heated, oh (like stolen Chanel, put me up in jail)
Whole lotta reservations, whole lotta
Whole lotta texting with no conversations
Whole lotta playing victim and the villain at the same time
Whole lotta, yeah, money, not a lot of patience
Whole lotta niggas been waiting, they want some time on it
Now I wanna flaunt it, panty and a bra, we can get evolved, boy (wake up pretty)
You keep playing my heart, boy, I'm just as petty as you are (petty, petty, petty, petty)
Only a real man can tame me
Only the radio can play me

Yada, yada, boom, boom, ka, ka
Blastin' on that ass, blast on that ass
Fan me quick, girl, I need my glass

Dimples on my hip, stretch marks on my tits
Drink on my water, mindin' my biz

Flip flop flippin', flip floppin' ass bitch
Fan me off, watch my wrist go click
Fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot
Like stolen Chanel, lock me up in jail
Cuff me, please, 'cause this ain't fair
Dripped in my pearls like Coco Chanel
Uncle Johnny made my dress
That cheap spandex, she looks a mess

Hey Ladies,"

Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength

But he's got to go he's got to go
Hey ladies why is it that men can go do us wrong

But he's got to go, he's got to go
My man's been cheatin' on me
Been runnin' round here wit' this little tenderoni
And don't think I haven't noticed
He's been actin' funny
Takin' too long to call me
And somebody told me
That the worst thing of it all is that he gave her
money
Now how he gon' give her my ends
That's a no, no
My first reactions telling me he's got to go, go
But I just ain't for sure
Should I just let him go
Oh I don't know
[2]
Yeah he did me wrong
But I love him so
I keep holding on
But he got to go, he got to go
Thought he was the one
But now I don't know
After what he's done
He's got to go, he's got to go
Repeat 1
You keep rewinding it
Stopin' it and playing yourself over again
See I'm sick and tired of you doin' that same old
thing
Sick of your same routine
Now you've got to come clean
Cause it's killing me
Repeat 2
Repeat 1
I just don't understand
You get chance after chance
And you say that you'll do right
But I really do not know if you can
It's not in your plans
That you've shown
Can you change, don't think so
Now I gotta let you go
Got to go-go-go-go-go
Got to go-go-go-go-go.

Mekhi:
Yo, we grew up together, we cut school together
When we have kids, go through terrible two's together
Reagan:
And when they turn three we'll be watchin' the news together
Cop found slain that kind of pain last forever
Mekhi:
So what you me to be, huh?
Reagan:
A man of your family
Mekhi:
What?  soccer dad, saturdays, load up the camry?
Reagan:
If i ever lost you the next would be my sanity
A house without you is not a home
It's more like amityville
Mekhi:
Come on, caela, you need to play fair, like vanity
You're the only woman that i speak with so candidly
You're the only woman i've been with, how can it be?
Theres other fish inside the sea, but none can swim beside you, see
But becomin' a cop is like becomin a man to me
Reagan:
And if you get shot then you'll become a body bag, you see
I love more than slaves love the thought of bein' free
Mekhi:
What, you and me?
Reagan:
Simpson
Mekhi:
Ashford
Both:
Eternally
Reagan:
What about a desk job
You still protect and servin' me
'cause i don't wanna get that call from the infirmary
Thoughts of your surgery constantly disturbin' me
Mekhi:
But possibly a captian, your pessimism's concernin' me
You know i love you i don't have to say it verbally
Wouldn't leave you in berlin in post-war germany
Reagn:
Somethin' just occured to me

Listen, only emergencyis me and you inside the bedroom

Hip Hop Star," 
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It's the player from the Point and your girl from the D
Are you infatuated with me
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that
My style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get nasty
I dare you to undress me
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll with this hip hop star
Baby I'm gone flow with my pants down low I'm hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this hip hop star
I'm a rock star
Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind
Would you tasted
My love if I kick it tight
I have none to waste wth you

Do you want to get messy

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me 'p' pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane,
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
Something don't feel right, because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

Jealous or crazy?

Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No!
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down

If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit ain't work, this light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours, why you mad take the good with the bad

Honesty," 
If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give
Chorus:
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you
I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize
If I wear my heart
Out on my sleeve
But I don't want
Some pretty face
To tell me
Pretty lies
All I want
Is someone
To believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep
Inside of me
Don't be
Too concerned
I won't ask
For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want
Sincerity
Tell me where else
Can I turn
Because
You're the one
That I depend upon
(Chorus)

Then we'll shoot across the sky
Oh, angels sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was hurt, withered, dried up
You came to rain a flood
So drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
We're on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Oh, angels sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

'Cause I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?
Rollin' high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what's good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talkin' lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did, smacked that trick
Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the number one chick, I don't need no hype
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?

[Lil Keke]
Yeah

Lil Keke the don, yes

Seven-thirteen homey, I been on
Yeah we been here and y'all sho been gone
Screwed up captain, still repping the south
And can't none of y'all cut me off, I'm alive
Make 'em southside, cause that's Texas pride
Pimp C got me swangin' it wide, so be quiet
Bey still repping it right for H-Town
Don Keke's draped up, chopped and screwed down
[Slim Thug]
I've been on, I've been on
Since back when I had braids on my dome
Underground king, sitting on my throne
Me and Bey done did number one songs
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace
This H-Town, we drive reckless
We make 'em bow down, they gon' respect us
[Beyoncé]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
[Willie D]
I am Houston, rep it hard
Cup with R, candy cars
Geto Boys, Willie D
You're plexing with Bey, you're plexing with me
These dudes in the streets, be acting (?)
But go to the pen, and be playing with them boys
They are not me, they're carbon copies
If God got me, who gon' stop me
[Scarface]
I been on
Now who you goons gon' get to knock me off
I've been boss
Been on slabs, been on paint
Been on fours homey, I've been on drapes
I've been half-baked
Twenty-five years and ain't fell off yet
Cause my flow that wet
You don't want no plex, they talk that sh-
The Queen Bey said you better bow down, bow down
[Beyoncé]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
[Z-Ro]
On, I could never be off
Hit the boulevard so hard, it'd never be soft
Yellow bone so long, looking like they reach out
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth
They call it Styrofoam City
Houston, Texas to be exact
Swangas on anything, it ain't gotta be a Lac
If I say I got sixteen, it ain't gotta be a wrap
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that
[Bun B]
We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh (?)
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring
While you sleeping and snoring
We, creeping and pouring
(?) Bey and the Bun, baby, you can't ignore 'em
Represent from Port Arthur, get it right off the water
How you want it harder, South, put in your order
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters
Ridin' for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol' up
[Beyoncé]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do
To have ya'll hating on me

Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm laying down in my bed
Thinking bout the things been said about me
When You really don't know me
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived
It's out my character for me to feed into ya
Feeling opressed
You must admire me spend so much time on me
Consuming yo head

(Oh) 
Yea-yeah, yeah, I got that 
Uh-huh, yo, yo

Deal with late pay and I got that from Hawk 
Plus I got my own bread 
You ain't gotta wave them over my head 
I got that 
(I got that) 
And you can't leave me stranded 
Cause I got a ride back 
And besides that 
What chick you know cock glocks back? 
Eight in the back, they rockin' hot jacks 
In high heels, mini skirts and thighs fat 
My styles like the international 
Pancake house or whatever avenue 
I got that, uh I got that 
1 - [Beyonce'] 
Think I need you cause the rent is due 
You can be outta here baby 
Cause I got it 
I got it, I got it 
Cause cash, coupes, credit cards 
All the exotic things baby 
I got it 
I got it, I got it 
[Amil] 
Ever since cats found out I ran with the Roc 
They wanna take a closer look, wanna examine the box 
Magazine want cameras to pop 
They catch me in the nude like a Samantha Fox 
Listen dude but I got dollars and cents 
You don't gotta promise me to pay my rent 
I got that 
(I got that) 
Catch me a drop black playing Speedy Gonzalez 
Toes never unpolished 
The way I be dressing dudes wanna toss the salad 
The way I be dressing got broads acting childish 
But I pay my own bills 
Amil-lion always has and always will 
Y'all got that? 
Repeat 1 
[Beyonce'] 
I got that 
The house that you live in 
I got that 
The bed that you sleep in 
I got that 
The Benz that you're driving 
I got that, I got that

The ice that you're wearing 
I got that 
So why you complaining 
I got that 
Who you gaming? 
I got that, I got that 
I got that 
[Amil] 
Yo my life's still on 
Gas bill caught up 
Indian Amil, call me chief running water 
Cable still in order 
Phone still dials out 
Money still long but my patience got shorter 
You can leave baby give me everything I bought you 
Like you leaving me was some type of torture 
I don't need no man to 
Do for Amil what Amil can do 
You got that? 
Repeat 1 (2x)

That's right baby 
Amil-lion, uh

I Miss You," 
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you, around
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you
But you're away
I said, I miss you
Missin' you insane
But if I got with you
Could it feel the same?
The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you
But you're away
I said, I miss you
Missin' you insane
But if I got with you
Could it feel the same?
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you
But you're away
I said, I miss you
Missin' you insane
But if I got with you
Could it feel the same?
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything

I Wanna Be Where You Are," 
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
Chorus:
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are
Bridge:
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
Chorus:
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are
 "
I Was Here," 
I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I wanna say I lived each day until I die
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts that I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved
I was here
I did (I did), I've done
I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved
I was here

I Will Always Love You / Halo," 
I will always
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you
Every step of the way
And I, will always love you
I will always love you
You
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Do your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
 "
I'd Rather Go Blind," 
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl
When I saw you and that girl walking out
Ooooo
I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Than to see you walk away from me chile
Ooooo
So you see, I love you so much
That I don't want to watch you leave me baby
Most of all, I just don't
I just don't want to be free no
Ooooo, Ooooo
I was just, I was just
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kisses and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass
That I held to my lips now, baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, oooo
And baby, baby I would rather be blind boy
Than to see you walk away
Walk away from me, yeah
And baby, baby I would rather be blind boy
Than to see you walk away
Walk away from me
Baby, baby, baby
 "
I'm Alone Now," 
It really hurts to say this, yes it does
But after our sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what gets so confusing baby?
You and me..
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me
Well I'm alone now, but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now, but I ain't the only
Honestly, I'm final take this time to concentrate on me
And I've got possibility to keep me company
Won't you just disown, he doesn't care
To eternalize it all just isn't fair
So why address the problem so that he
But I still feel alone, lonely, when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby, I know we can
If I make you miss it baby, then maybe you would understand
That I'm alone now, but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now, but I ain't the only
Honestly, I'm final take this time to concentrate on me
And I've got possibility to keep me company
Lalalalala...
Well I'm alone now, but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now, but I ain't the only
Honestly, I'm final take this time to concentrate on me
And I've got possibility to keep me company
 "
I'm Glad There Is You," 
In this world
Of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world
Of over-rated pleasures
Of under-rated treasures
I'm glad there is you
I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role so new,
I'll walk it through with you to guide me
In this world
Where many, many play at love
But hardly ever stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever,
I'm glad there is you
More than ever,
I'm glad there is you, you
 "
I'm Leaving," 
[Chorus:]
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
[Verse 1]
I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up
But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go
[Chorus]
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
[Verse 2]
Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine
You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I,
I gotta move on
[Chorus]
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)

Ice Cream Truck," 
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe
You belong to me, oh oh
I'm going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesnt feel like this
This is my final wish
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please dont stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go
Let me do B
You've got me chasing after you
Like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)
You've got me chasing after you
Like an ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally you stopped and I jumped on
I realized the flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holdin on
You looked and I was gone, no
The next your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please dont stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go
Let me do B

Chasing you
My hearts melting
It's like ice cream

Cause you got me
Chasing you
My hearts melting

Now it's time to let you go

But you don't love me
(It's always out of luck)
It's got to end
(And my heart just melts)
I tried so hard
(You got me chasing after you)
Damn there lost my mind
(Like an ice cream truck)
'Cause real love is hard to find
(I try my best to catch up but)
Now my heart can't take no more

Now I know boy you ain't mine

If," 
He's always laughing and flirting with me and
You act like you don't even care
As a matter a fact, you've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen, and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, ooh baby
If you let him take me from you
Why is it that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you, dance or whatever
And your homeboys' more interested than you
He pays more attention to me that you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen, and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, ooh baby
If you let him take me from you
Boy when I tried to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
You want some lovin', that's when it's cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool
Boy, oh!
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
(Ooh!) you never wanted me
Let this happen, and it proves
(No no no!)
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, ooh baby
(How can you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you
(Are you gonna let him take me from you)
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see (x2)
If you let him take me from you
(No no)you never wanted me
Let this happen, and it proves
(Just let me go)
That your love was never true
(Let me go)
If you let him take me from you, ooh baby
(Just let me know)
If you let him take me from you

If I Were a Boy," 
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
And you don't understand
(And you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl 
Someday you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy

So I go to clubs with the guys
And sometimes flirt with the girls
I should be able to roll out
As long as I'm coming home to you
And give you the world
But you are not a boy
So you dont have a clue (ey)
How I work and pay the bills
Girl, and everything I do is for you (eh eh)

'Cause I know how it hurts

'Cause he's taking you for granted

So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
(Girl, you know that's wrong)
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'll be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home
But you are not a boy
So you can't understand
You are not a perfect woman
And I am not a perfect man (remix, remix)
I'd listen to her (eh eh)
'Cause I know how it hurts (and I know how you feel)
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
Said I'm sorry
It's a little too late for you to come back
But I cant let you go
'Cause I'm too attached

If Looks Could Kill," 
Beyonce' - Sweetness flowing like a faucet
Body bangin' up corset
Brothas wanna toss it
But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit
Slicker than a porpis and thicker than a horses
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I'll stick to my thesis, I'll stick to my features
Brothas trying to hold, but their game never reaches
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you looking at, but what you looking at?
You in a bar, wanna twist me like a bottle cap
Mos Def - I'm trying to holla Miss, to see if you
Gonna holla back
Beyonce' - Your game is whack, and know you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunkin that
Mos Def - But this is Miller, Lieutenant, if you're wondering
Sarpong - And I'm the thag
Mos Def - Mel Gibson
Sarpong - Danny Gloverin'
Beyonce' - But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling
See, I have dreams with a man, what will become of
Him?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should post pone my goals, he got tricks up his
Sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down
Mos Def - I got a warrant for ya heart and a bedroom and trial
Sarpong - Get a pardon if you come with the Sergeant, now
Beyonce' - Give me a chair, cause I don't care, I
Ain't feeling your style
Mos Def - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty
Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you
Sarpong - But I'm an officer shorty
Beyonce' - My looks are killing you
Mos Def - Murder One will get you under the covers
Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas
Mos Def - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty
Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you
Sarpong - But I'm an officer shorty
Beyonce' - My looks are killing you
Mos Def - Murder One will get you under the covers
Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling
You brothas
Eyes like the ocean
Mos Def - Ma, I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise 'em high and daddy long stroke you
Beyonce' - Hair like forever
Sarpong - Swear I could do it better
Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta
Beyonce' - Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that kid...
Mos Def - Don't waste your time, he ain't no doing, he's just a Sergeant
Passing out tickets for parking
Sarpong - Chickenheads clucking
Beyonce' - Pitiful bulls barking
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I'm walking
Girls getting jealous, cause they man always hawking
Even got Lou looking at me like he stalking
And I got a mind too
I wouldn't bless you,
If your first name was ""Hachu"" on Sunday singing
Gospel
Mos Def - You ain't a dime, just a nickel acting
Hostel
Beyonce' - I'm headed for the big time, I'm bouncing on this side-show...

If you leave her
I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hideaway
Oh, Just you and me
I peep game long time ago,
When he told me, he never seen a chick before
He wouldn't give me no explaination
Cause he knows when I pack my bags it ain't for no
vacation
I'm gonna do my thing,
I'm leaving his alone,
Oh I'm moving on my way
He's history, history
If he believe it's over, your'll see
A girl gotta do what she gotta do,
Oh oh oh

If you leave her
I'll leave him

Don't say a word

To another place
Let's hideaway
Oh, Just you and me

I call 612-555-2422
to find you
I packed my bag's,
Gased up the jag,
and tell my dad,
Your the finest girl I ever had,
Can't tell my lady,
that a mess up page maine,
I know it might sound crazy,
but say your'll be my baby
She crushed my new benz
Slept with my best friend,
Spend all my ends,
It's got to end
[Beyonce]
Oh, how do I know
you won't hurt me,
Like he has,
I know you say you want me bad
[RL]
You gotta have faith in me,

You know I do,

To make everything, baby
Cuz my love, it's alright its all you'll ever need

This love was meant to be

It's our destiny

Inevitably," 
You are alone, and I'd be a piss
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you bet all of you and wanted nothing else for me
But come back sometimes for you but else I met you was only
I couldn't see but now I know that I acted selfishly
I should of known that I let you down and caused you so much misery
And never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea
All of the times you used to cry
Because I would let you down
All of the times I should of tried a little more to be around
But I didn't know you were hurting I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain another you I'll never find

Irreplaceable," 
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it, please, don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for one second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for one second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be your nothing?
Nothing at all to you
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left

Nigga, pack all your bags, we're finished
(You must not know about me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know about me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for one second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
 "
Irreplaceable (Irreemplazable)," 
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé, mmm
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves, amor, esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón
Están tus cosas, esto se acabó
Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya, ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás
Y si acaso piensas
Que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás, que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate
¿Qué sabes tu de mi?
No me hagas reir
Tu creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi?
No me hagas reir
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor
Ya me curé de dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate, me das asco
Tu eres mi luz
Pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz
Y si acaso piensas
Que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás, que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate
¿Qué sabes tu de mi?
No me hagas reir
Tu creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor
Ya no soy nada para ti
Alguién que no conoces
Lo nuestro se acabó
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó
Nunca lloraré por ti
Porque ya me cansé de ti
No eres más imprescindible
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé, mmm
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves, amor
Esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor
¿Qué sabes tu de mi?
No me hagas reir
Tu creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi?
No me hagas reir
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? (Baby)
No me hagas reir
Tu creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme
(No hay más que hablar, terminamos)
¿Qué sabes tu de mi?
(Este cuento al fin se he acabado)
No me hagas reir
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte

[C.C.:] Effie, Curtis was supposed to...
[Effie:] Love me. Curtis was supposed to love me.
[Curtis:] There you are Effie. I've been looking all over.
[Effie:] I turn my back and find myself out on the line. You could have warned me, but that would have been too kind!
[Curtis:] I've been warning you for months to clean up your act. You've been late; you've been mean; given all kinds of bullshit flack.
[Effie:] That's a lie! That's a lie! It's just I haven't been feeling that well. 
[Curtis:] Effie, please. Stop excusing yourself. You've been late; you've been mean and getting fatter all the time.
[Effie:] Now you lying, lying; I never been so thin. You lying, lying, 'cause your knocking up that piece who thinks she's better than everybody. She ain't better than anybody, she ain't nothing but common!
[Deena:] Now who you callin' common you self-indulgent, self-absorbed and unprofessional...
[Effie:] You! I'm calling you, I'm calling you, the common piece is knocking off!
[Deena:] Now you listen to me, Miss Blame-It-On-The-World. See I put up with you for much too long. I have put up with your bitching, I've put up with your nagging, and all your screaming too!
[Lorelle:] Oh now when are you two gonna stop all this fighting? 
[Effie:] Stay outta this Lorelle, this is between Deena and me!
[Lorelle:] Yeah, well it's between me too! I am as much a part of this group as anybody else! And I'm tired, Effie I'm tired, of all the problems you're making up!
[Effie:] I always knew you two were together!
[Lorelle:] What!
[Effie:] Always knew you two were ganging up on me!
[Deena:] She had nothing to do with this change. It was you! It was you always thinking of you. Always thinking of you!
[Curtis:] I knew you were trouble from the start.
[Effie:] Trouble?
[Curtis:] You were real bad trouble from the start!
[Effie:] Curtis, I'm your woman!
[Curtis:] You're getting out now...I'm not building this group to have you tear it apart. Go ahead and rant and scream and shout. Don't worry baby, I'll buy you out.
[Effie:] There's no money dirty enough to buy me out. You remember that, Curtis.
[C.C.:] Lay off Effie, just take the money and run.
[Effie:] You in this with them, C.C.?
[C.C.:] Cool it Effie, this time you know what you've done!
[Effie:] So they've got your black ass too, huh?
[C.C.:] I said cool it Effie, this time you've gone too far.
[Effie:] Oh I can go further, I can go further!
[Michelle:] I don't wanna stay around this. I'm just breaking into this business. This is between all of you. This is none of my affair. 
[Effie:] Yeah? Well it's between you too now, little sister. This small job is just as much your sin. Look at me, look at me! How much did you put out to get in?
[Michelle:] Now you watch your mouth, watch your mouth, Ms. Effie White. 'Cause I don't take that talk from no second-rate diva, who can't sustain.
[Effie:] I'm not feeling well. I've got pains.
[Everyone:] Effie, we all got pains!
[Effie:] Oh! Is that alright also with you? I was your sister!
[Everyone:] You were trouble.
[Effie:] Now you're telling me it's all over?
[Everyone:] And now we're telling you: it's all over.
[Effie:] And now I'm telling you, I ain't going!
[Everyone:] It's all over.
[Effie:] I ain't going!
[Everyone:] It's all over.

I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.
I'll be damned!
My man was one of those neat freaks. Everything just had to be sparkless: the floors, his shirts, even the silverware. One day I was sick and tired of being the maid. So, that night, i ran his bath water extra watts. Then I accidentally dropped his radio onto the water! I finally put the sparkle back into our relationship. At least he died clean !ha ha ha
I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.2x
I'll be damned if I see, I'll be damned if I see
I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.
I'll be damned!
We were high school sweethearts. We went to prom together, graduated together and we even went to college together. He was my first everything. I just knew he'd be my husband. Until one day I got an invite to his wedding in e-mail. Damn right, I showed up, I wanted to congratulate him personally. After all, it does said ""'till death do us apart"", all right ?
I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.2x
I'll be damned if I see, I'll be damned if I see
I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.
I'll be damned!
We met in my salsa dance class. His moves were so intoxicating. Let's just say.. we danced on the dance-floor, in the bedroom, the kitchen, my BMW, AI PAPI ! Until one day, he decided to switch from salsa to ballet. And I caught him in first position with my best friend, Carlos. Now they both can tango for eternity!
I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.2x
I'll be damned if I see, I'll be damned if I see
I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.
I'll be damned!
I've always been and independent woman (question !). But I knew he was broke when I met him. But I didn't mind, though, 'cause he always put it down. I took him everywhere, India, Brazil, Milan, you name it. But little did I know, he was picking up a souvenir in every city. So when I caught him with that extra souvenir, i stabbed his passport to his final destination: to hell !
I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.2x
I'll be damned if I see, I'll be damned if I see
I'll be damned if I see another chick on his arm.

Jealous," 
I’m in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink
In this glass, don’t make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you’re not honest
Now you got me yelling
That’s because I’m jealous
If you keep me your promise
I’m keeping mine
Oh, I’m jealous
If you keep me your promise
I’m keeping mine
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
“Baby girl, you can’t survive like this”
Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
’Yoncé filling out this skirt
I look damn good I ain’t lost it
And I ain’t missed a beat
Boy, you been hanging out tonight
I’m staying out ’til tomorrow
Been dancing on them tables
Ain’t got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don’t be jealous
If you keep me your promise
I’m keeping mine
Oh, I’m jealous?
If you keep me your promise
I’m keeping mine
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
“Baby girl, you can’t survive like this no, no, no”
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don’t judge me
And I know I’m being hateful but that ain’t nothing
That ain’t nothing
I’m just jealous
I’m just human
Don’t judge me
If you keep me your promise
I’m keeping mine
Oh, I’m jealous
If you keep me your promise
I’m keeping mine

And that includes my sweet little nooky too, too

How you gon' neglect this? You was just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie Craig
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone
You'd rather go and party?
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Actin' like I'm nobody

Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you
'Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face

Ten years together, still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high-school sneaking with my boyfriend
Part of this watchin', boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my babe

Learn To Be Lonely," 
Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed that out in the world
There are arms to hold you
You've always known
Your heart was on it's own
So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed that out in the world
There are arms to hold you
You've always known
Your heart was on it's own
So laugh in your loneliness

Listen," 
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own all 'cause you won't
Listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known
Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened, there is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own all 'cause you won't
Listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known
Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Oh, now I'm done believing you

But now I've gotta find my own, my own

Oye
Lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye
Cómo llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención, debes oír
Hoy
No sé quién soy ni sé a dónde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misión
De tu prisión, por fin, ya soy libre
Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor, voy a partir

Que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad
Qué gran error
Hoy grito
No tengo más temor

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me a hard, make me lose my (hah hah)
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like you don't know what to do
After I done did everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you
I'm starting to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them nights like you satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me
Oooh
Two things I don't like when I'm trying get my groove
Is a partener that meets me only half way, and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard, and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Oooh
You understand the facts that I'm trying get to you
You moving so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference from a man and an adolescent
It ain't you boo, so get stepping
If you can't make we say ooo
Like the beat of this drun
Why you ask for some, you really want none
If you can't mke we say ooo
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business
And this is your papers
Baby you are dismissed, dismissed
Dismissed, dismissed

Lost Yo' Mind," 
OMG, you done lost yo' motherf*cking mind!
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
They told me 'bout all the lies
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (it wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find?
You must've just lost yo mind
I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up, even the numbers
Let me exactly hear, but you you wonder
I know how my mama felt getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here, this one is over
Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying
Now that it's over, I can move on from here
Glad that it's over, so glad that it's over
I could've told ya it's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya, but I'm not a pushover no more
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
They told me 'bout all the lies
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (it wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find?
You must've just lost yo mind
You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than yo woman, I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya, but you picked the colors
At night you'll get over, yeah, like you will never
I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying
Now that it's over, I can move on from here
Glad that it's over, so glad that it's over
The melody told ya exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy, I'm not a pushover
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
They told me 'bout all the lies
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (it wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find?
You must've just lost yo mind
I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get, I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying
Now that it's over, I can move over
Glad that it's over, so glad that it's over
You just confirmed it, this ain't a warning
Been living a double life, you must have lost yo mind
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (you crazy)
You must've just lost yo mind (you crazy)
They told me 'bout all the lies (you lost yo mind)
I took you back all those times (tell ya one more time)
You must have lost yo mind (you lost yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (it was not mine)
Many earrings must I find? (hey)
You must've just lost yo mind
You just lost yo mind

Love Again," 
I never knew you were so weak to love someone
Always will be loving someone so good and right
His touch was the smoother that I'd seen
I was wishing you were there, but I remember your face
Always when I'm needing of someone, I'm alone and lonely
You were lovely, and I can't forget about you
Sometimes I wanna live on your side, again
But, I won't forget you, won't take it out of my head
Now, I'm trying memorizing your skin touching on mine
I've missed you all this time, where have you been?
I'm confused, and don't know why I'm doing it
'Cause I've been thinking how I've passed my time with you
My mind tells me you won't remember of me
But I like of who you are, and now I'm hopeless
You burned all my eyes, and I'm lifeless
I've been tired wondering if you would do the same
You've been slipping all the times you wanted to say
It was like something I didn't know, and I know now
Your rain is falling on the floor, and I saw you raining
I supposed be in love when I said for you
Now, I'm runnin' trying to find somewhere to go
And I can say ""you're pretty, baby""
And I can see everything I haven't seen
So, why are you comin' around of away?
I should've know
I'm numb, trying to remember all the memories
I just wanna be in love, be in love again
I just wanna understand, why are you so pretty
And I can't leave this tears fall again
I don't wanna you see me crying for you
Even that be so hard trying forget everything
I don't wanna you go away, again
I'll be in love again, if you could see me
You've been slipping all the times you wanted to say
It was like something I didn't know, and I know now
Your rain is falling on the floor, and I saw you raining
I supposed be in love when I said for you
Now, I'm runnin' trying to find somewhere to go
And I can say ""you're pretty, baby""
And I can see everything I haven't seen

I just wanna be in love, be in love again
I just wanna understand, why are you so pretty

Even that be so hard trying forget everything
I don't wanna you go away, again
I'll be in love again, if you could see me

Love Drought," 
Ten times out of nine, I know you‘re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you’re trying
So I’m trying to be fair
And you’re trying to be there, and to care
And you’re caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I’ve been giving goes unnoticed
It’s just floating in the air
Look it there, are you aware?
You’re my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn’t me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day?
Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don’t care about the lights or the beams
I’d spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up
Skin thick, too tough
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could move a mountain
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could calm a war down
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could make it rain now
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could stop this love drought
Nine times out of ten, I’m in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I’m only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I’m movin’ on
I’ve always been committed, I’ve been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you’re my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn’t B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day?
Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don’t care about the lights or the beams
I’d spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up
Them old bitches so wack, I’m so tough
Wassup?
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could move a mountain
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could calm a war down
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me could make it rain now
And you, you, you
You and me would stop this love drought
‘Cause you, you, you
You and me would stop this love drought

Love On Top," 
Bring the beat in!
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the Sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away
Now, everybody ask me why
I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say that love hurts)
But I know
(It's gonna take a little work)
Oh, woah
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And, finally, you put me first
Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need, you make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top

As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again
Now everybody ask me why
I'm smiling out from ear to ear

But I know

"Me, Myself And I"," 
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that, with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I've got me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend
You're so controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend

I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you) yeah
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the Sun come out again, yeah, ayy
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
(I've got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times, ladies, you will survive

Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way

I can see the Sun shine, I got me, myself and I

Medley VMA 2016," 
[Pray You Catch Me]
I tried to make a home out of you
But doors lead to trap doors, a stairway leads to nothing
Where do you go when you go quiet?
The past and the future merge to meet us here
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath
As you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt
Like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me (Prayin')
I'm prayin' you catch me
[Hold Up]
I tried to change
Fasted for 60 days
Closed my mouth more, wore white, abstained from mirrors
Tried to be softer, prettier, less awake
I bathed in bleach, and plugged my menses with pages from the holy book
But still inside me, coiled deep, was the need to know
Are you cheating on me? Are you cheating on me?
Hello MTV, y'all havin' a good time?
I want y'all to help me to sing this sing
Here we go!
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets
I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't want to lose my pride
But I'mma - fuck me up a bitch
I know that I kept it sexy
I know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing
Maybe my head for one
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like bein' walked all over lately
Walked all over lately?
I'd rather be crazy
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down
Hey, it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like bein' walked all over lately
Walked all over lately?
I'd rather be crazy
[Sorry]
So what are you gonna say at my funeral now that you've killed me?
Here lies the body of the love of my life
Whose heart I broke without a gun to my head
Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead
Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted
Her Heaven would be a love without betrayal
Ashes to ashes... dust to sidechicks
Everybody, let me here you sing!
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
Sing it, sing it now
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry

I ain't picking up
I'm headed to this club
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÉ cups
I don't give a *aw*, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my b-, pause, I had enough
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout
Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him: Boy, bye!
Tell him: Boy, bye! Boy, bye!
Middle fingers up

Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today I've regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them stupid excuses
I pray to Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't thinking 'bout nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie, better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair
[Don't Hurt Yourself]
Oh, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la
Don't hurt yourself
Who the f*ck do you think I am?
You ain't married to no average bitch, boy
You can watch my fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next d*ck, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Get a bigger smile on my face being alone

You're only lying to yourself
When you love me, you love yourself
Love god herself

Never Gonna Love Again (Unreleased)," 
The scent of lust and fame
Perfume and cheap cocaine
Bombarded by marauders and their sons
But mostly daughters with no shame
You're so quick to lose their names
'Cause they're all the same
Tune them out to pray again
Release your guilt and shame
You're fooled by another mirage
You're fooled by another menage
A fool is just a fool, just play it cool
Just keep collecting your applause
A devil with no cause
It all comes back, we all go limp
We all can't win, we sin the same old sins
He never gonna drink again
He never gonna smoke again
He never fucking up again
He sin the same old sins
I'm never gonna love again
Never gonna trust again
I'm never love a thug again
I'll never gonna love again
Never gonna love again
Never gonna love again
You drag me in the rain
We swerving off the lane
He finished when he started
When he lost and he was king and she escaped
We all can't run the game
It all comes back, we all go limp
We all can't win, we sin the same old sins
He never gonna drink again
He never gonna smoke again
He never fucking up again
But you sin the same old sins
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna trust again
I'm never leaning in again
I'll never gonna love again
Never gonna love again
So I see, the same old
So I see, the same old
So I see, the same old
So I see, the same old
He's never gonna drink again
He never gonna smoke again
Never fucking up again
We sin the same old sins
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna trust again
I'll never fuck a thug again
We sin the same old sins

Don't look so funny?

Joke's on you
And you're good at bets
So where's my money
I know you bet
And I would never make that move
So why's the house empty
Light's off by the end of this week
I'll leave with what I came with baby
I'll take dogs, you keep the Mercedes
'Cause I'm gone I'm not staying
I'll walk these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face
'Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
Too bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
Aha I'll send you a postcard
Hey baby
You seem to ghost this ain't yo lady
This is the chick that you held back now
Now all of the things you've said were crazy
I checked out my list and I feel good about it
I got the new haircut
The one that you said that wouldnt look no good
Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit
'Cause you're gone and I'm great
I got rid of your dead way
And ill wave at you behind me
With a new smile on my face
'Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns

NILE (feat. Kendrick Lamar)," 
One time I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now
Plunging away 'less my body's on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
Where danger finds me, it follows with tides
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
She said: Hey, little buddy, where you goin'?
I'm not sure of how to know I'm still motion
You seem regular, I seem regular
These streams may take me out to the ocean
Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then I'll dive in it 'til I'm exhausted and I'm type lacking
Waistline on four deep
Senses on forty
Feel like there's four of me
One time I took a swim in the Nile
(One time I took in a swim in the Nile)
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around

Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit

One Night Only," 
Haaaa

Haaaa

(One night only)
You want all my love and my devotion
You want my loving soul right on the line
I have no doubt that I could love you forever
The only trouble is I really don't have the time
I've got one night only
One night only
That's all I have to spare
One night only
Let's not pretend you care
I've got one night only
One night only
Come on, big baby, come on

If the storm comes, if we burn up
If the wells run dry
You're my reason to believe in
Another life
If it all ends and it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me, you will see me
On the other side
If we wake up, lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
I feel lucky to say that you've been
A friend of mine
Best believe me, you will see me

Part II (On The Run) (feat. Jay-Z)," 
Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
And the missing love that's misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces, chuck the D'usse
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say
I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's 'til the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'mma wave this Tec, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack
Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl
'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
Deeper then words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
(Without you I got nothing to lose)

As a Black woman
I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box
And Black women often feel underestimated
And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process
Be proud of the struggle
Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain
Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right
And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves
Their sass, their honesty
Thankful for their freedom

Perfect Duet (feat. Ed Sheeran),"

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight
[Beyoncé]
Well, I found a man
Stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams
I hope that someday we'll share our home
I found love
To carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes
Oh baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
[Beyoncé & Ed Sheeran]
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass

Pink + White (feat. Frank Ocean)," 
Yeah, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah yeah
That's the way everyday goes
Every time we have no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Half way on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool in this good life
Won't let you down when it's all ruined
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Good Glory, dear
It's all downhill from here
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower, milk crate
It's the same way you showed me
Cannon ball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it up when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Where God could fear
It's all downhill from here
What a life
Remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in this year
Say what up to Magic, just shoot
Say what up to Penny
Say what up to life one more time
And I know what you might want to know
Run from me and your team
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy)
Give me somethin' sweet
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin'
This is life, life immortality

PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA," 
Boy, I know that you can't help it but be yourself 'round me, yourself 'round me, no
And I know nobody's perfect, so I'll let you be
I'll let you be
It's the way you wear your emotion on both of your sleeves, ah
To the face you make when I tell you I have to leave, ooh
But I like it, baby, ooh
I like it, baby
But I like it, baby, baby
But I like it, baby
Ah, we don't need the world's acceptance
They're too hard on me, they're too hard on you, boy
I'll always be your secret weapon in your arsenal, your arsenal
And I know you had it rough growing up but that's okay (that's okay, baby), I like it rough (that's okay, baby)
Even when you let your feelings get in the way (let your feelings get in the way)
I still like it, baby
Ooh, I like it, baby (like it, baby)
But I like it, baby (like it, baby), baby, baby (like it, baby)
I still like it, baby, baby, baby, baby
Say, say you won't change
I love the little things that make you, you
Ooh, the rest of the world is strange, just stay in our lane
Just you and me and our family
I think you're so cool, even though I'm cooler than you
Boy, I love that you can't help it but be yourself around me, yourself around me
Sugar, well, you trippin', I know we'll make up and make love
So I let you be, I let you be
It's the way you listen when I'm cryin', you let me lean in
It's the way you want one more kiss after you said you are leaving
But I like it, baby, baby (yes, I like it, baby, yes, I like it, baby)
Yes, I like it, baby (like it, baby)
Like it (like it), I like it
I love it, baby
I like it, baby

 "
Poison," 
You're bad for me, I clearly get it
I don't see how something good
Could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss
You're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need
To fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart-breaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flatlines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis? Will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin
That broke my heart down, baby?
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
It's just not my body
It's my mind, you don't know how many times
I told myself this can't do
And that I don't need you
(No, I don't need you, no)
It's so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what's good is that when you're not always there
You're no good for my health, my health
You're just like poison
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You're just like poison
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How could something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch twenty-two
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't wanna do
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

Pray (feat. Jay Z)," 
[Beyonce talking]
Delivery me from my enemies oh god
Defend me from those that rise up against me
Deliver me from the work of inequities
The savior from the blood of me
[Jay-z - verse one]
Look, mind state of a gangster from the 40's
Meet the vicious mind of motown's berry gordy
Turn crack rocks into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry my jewelery so gordy
Slid into the party with my new pair of maury's
America meet the gangsta shawn corey
Hey young world wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you could pretend your me
A cut from the cloth of the kennedy's
Frank sinatra having dinner with the genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother america's not witnessing
The harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocences as the incents burn
And the turn tables turn and that al greens plays
I see my mother's afro as momma taps her toes as she rolls her jays
And my poppa just left the house, in search of the killer of my uncle ray
And she's trying to calm my nerves, as I observe this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store we could never be sure so all we can do is
Pray
[Beyoncé talking]
Because of your strength
While I walked upon the
For god is my defense
[Jay-z]
As I head towards my home room I observe the rooms though needles on the ground
I hear a car go vrooom drug dealer in the bm with the top down
As the girls start to giggle I ask why you laugh they say ""you too little""
One day you'll understand when you become a man 'bout things you have to get you
Fast forward freeze frame on my pistol
Fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life this life chose me
Around here is the shit that you just do
I just left school, the same bm is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had they guns drawn screaming just move
Unless there something else you suggest we can do
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like a huh
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt he called paying dues
Now when the rules is blurred as they hears a what am I to do
But pray, pray the lord forgive me
Pray guys goodbye for what I'm about go through
Pray
[Beyoncé talking]
Delivery me in thy righteousness
It cause me to escape and climb thy air until I am
Save me lord
[Jay-z]
Anyway there's oppression the drug profession
Flourishes like beverages refreshing
Sweet taste of sin everything I've seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or I victim I beg
What came first moving chickens or the egg
This is why I be so fresh I'm trying to beat life
Because I can't cheat death
The truth is the shamelessness ain't stainless is that aim this is
You know who's game this is
Move coke like pepsi it don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine everything I do I'm a man behind mine
I'm not a angel I'm sure but every night before I lay
I drop my knees to the floor and I pray
[Beyonce talking]
The name shall endure forever
The name shall continue as long as the sun will
Men shall be blessed in him
All nations shall call him blessed
In your name I pray
For you blessings
 "
Pray You Catch Me," 
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath
As you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt
Like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me (prayin')
I'm prayin' you catch me

Pretty Hurts," 
Ms. Third Ward, your first question
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy
Mama said: You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
You're tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down
Pretty hurts
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
You're tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery
Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's my soul, it's my soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past
Pretty hurts
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
You're tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery
When you're alone all by yourself
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And you're lying in your bed
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself?
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
You stripped away the masquerade
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself?
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself?
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Yeah, yes
Ah-ah, ah

Proud Mary," 
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for The Man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry though you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.

But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it

Like err'day
Makin' sure the DJ know
What I want him to play
You know I got my top back
And my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades
And turnin' up my radio
Turnin' up my radio
I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
The only one that papa allowed
To hang out in my room
With the door closed
We'd be alone
And mama never freaked out
When she heard it go boom
'Cause she knew we
Were in the zone
Hold him in my arms
And look out on my window
Under the moonlight
And he, deep, keepin' my close
So I never let him go
He's got a place in my heart
I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
When I get into my car, turn it up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my trunk
And then bass all be rattlin' through my seats
Then that crazy feeling starts happening
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ
Playing the stuff I like
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart
I think I'm in love with my radio
Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
Whenever I hear that sound
I be on the hotline,

Makin' sure the DJ know

You know I got my top back
And my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades
And turnin' up my radio
Turn up my radio

Because it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo

Open my heart
Speak our truth
Together we unwind like a corkscrew

'Cause I'd rather die young
Than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young
Than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I've ever seen
That burns like gasoline
So light a match
Turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you
'Cause this might be our last night
'Cause I'd rather die young
Than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young
Than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life
It's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young
Than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young
Than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all
Than live my life without you

Resentment," 
I wish I could believe you then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can and I
I tried, and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I'll always remember feeling
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried, and I tried to forgive this
But I'm too damn full of resentment
I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinking
""What's up with Bey?""
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me?
I used to be so strong
But now you took my soul
I'm crying
Can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could have told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look at what you been done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes
And see she has had half of me
How could you lie?

Ring Off," 
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""
Until you had enough, then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish this didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""
Until you had enough, then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, crying, fighting
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
After all your tears
After all, that pain's all clear, mama
After all them years
We can start all over again, mama
And now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end, mama
We can love again
This is where freedom begins, mama
So put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody, put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top

But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long

Tell me how should I feel when you made me belong?
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it, and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
Oh-ooh, he's so arrogant and bold
Oh-ooh, but she gon' love that shit, I know

'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'mma cause
She gon' be rockin' Chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go

Damn, if let you go
Oh-ooh, how can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Oh-ooh, why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
Oooh, but this is my show, and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me and not see all the things?
She gon' be rockin' Chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go

Robot," 
I've been having a hard time sleeping
It's 7 am
And I've been up for about two hours.
I landed and did a show
And I had three shows in a row
And then in my day off
I had to go into the studio.
Yesterday was another show,
As soon as I got off of the stage
I had to get on a train,
I didn't get in until one in the morning.
Then I have another show,
And another show.
It's gonna be like almost nine days
Without resting my voice
And my body and my mind.
I'm just really upset that
I don't have
Anyone that's concerned about
My body and my wellbeing.

Climb until you reach my peak babe, my peak, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep end, your deep end, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flowing flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this space
Lemme put it in your face
By the way
If you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create
Rockets and waterfalls
So rock right up to
The side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak babe, my peak, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep end, your deep end, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flowing flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe

Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me
Hard rock steady, rock hard, rock steady
Rock hard, rock steady, rock hard, rock steady
Don't you know that I give you
The loving, if you need it?
I give you my word
You can believe it
Your love feels like
All four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason
Swimming
My love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the lord, boy
Kiss me
Pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, 'til the water falls down
Damn
And I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh, child, ooh, now

Rolling On The River!," 
ROLLING ON THE RIVER (Letra)
Y' know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
But there's just one thing
You see we never ever do nothing
Nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're gonna take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're gonna do the finish rough
This is the way we do proud mary
And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
Listen to the story
I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in memphis
Pumped a lot of tane down in new orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Till I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
If you come down to the river
I bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes

Runnin’ (Lose It All) (feat. Naughty Boy / Arrow Benjamin)," 
These four lonely walls have changed the way I feel
The way I feel, I'm standing still
And nothing else matters now, you're not here
So where are you? I've been calling you
I'm missing you
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you
Memories turn to dust, please don't bury us
I got you, I got you
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
I've outrun the fears that chased, they're standing still
I'm running still, I'm running still
And every voice that cries inside my head, forever drives
Forever drives, into lights
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I, if I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all

I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
Well, every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
Well, every promise don't work out that way
And your heart is broken cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way

It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation
Think how happy we can be
When we just try
When nothing like we've seen
Passionate words were never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side
In your eyes
Love's alive
We've come on time
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change
We're always on display
Let's run and hide
In our eyes
Love's alive
We've come on time
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We had all the love we need
While we're a part I cannot breathe

Save The Hero," 
I lay alone awake at night, sorrow feels my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
But whose gonna be mine?
Who's there to save the hero, oh
When she's left all alone, and she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero, oh
Who's there to save the girl after she saves the world
After she saves the world
I bottle all my hurt inside, I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life
I serve the world a gesture, someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this burried treasure, they both lead to a higher goal
Who's there to save the hero, oh
When she's left all alone, and she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero, oh
Who's there to save the girl after she saves the world
After she saves the world (after she saves the world)
After she saves the world
After she saves the world
I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
I'm crying out for help
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself
Who's there to save the hero, oh
When she's left all alone, and she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero, oh
Who's there to save the girl after she saves the world
After she saves the world (after she saves the world)
After she saves the world
After she saves the world
After she saves the world

In the jungle, ain't no bible

Show no fear, boy, where's your spinal?
Where's your backbone? Where's your pyro?

My own idol skipped my trial
Took my rightful, rightful title
No remorse, the sin is final
I found all my own disciples
I'm too far gone, downward spiral
No white angels, just albinos
Check my eyes, man, they're all white, man
Roll them back now, where'd the light go?
Guess it died so, cold like Kryo
Crack my neck back like I'm the chiro

Scared Of Lonely," 
I'm in this fight, and I'm swinging
And my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand, and I can't barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of be the only
Shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of only heart beat
I hear a beating is my own
And I'm scared of been alone
I can't see the breath when I am lost
In this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you, I'll stretch your hand looking for mine
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of be the only
Shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of only heart beat

Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

Said the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?

Mom and dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made them want me more
At fourteen, they asked what I wanna be
I said: Baby, twenty-one, so I get me a drink

Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barneys, we at de Bonny's
End up at Marley, Georgi, and service from Sergio
Da Kine Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellafied vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, thirty-two

'Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae

Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is paegantries
Cannonball off the diving board when I aboard
All my homies GDs, but I am lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's something that you could use in analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality
Now go get my throne
'Cause I don't wanna stop

Designer scarf, work of art, rockin' vintage Gucci
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some buds
Daddy, I got what you need, you a sexy lil thug
Don't wanna be your girl, I ain't lookin' for no love
So come give me a hug, you a sexy lil thug
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some buds
Daddy, I got what you need, you a sexy lil thug
Don't wanna be your girl, I ain't lookin' for no love
So come give me a hug, you a sexy lil thug
My nails, my hair, my diamond rings
Shining with all my fancy things
My crib, my car, my clothes, my jewels
Why u mad?
Cause I came up and I ain't changed
I'm that girl wearing Chanel pearls
Chandeliers in my ears from Bailey Bank and Biddle
You feelin' my style
You feelin' my flow
Hair sheek, smells sweet
Like coated flow
I'm the lady sipping Baileys
While I strut like a model
If the ladies wanna hate me
I just send them a bottle
I know I got it
But don't flaunt it
Even though brothers want it
Dancin' dirty while I'm flirting
Cuz he's checkin' up on me
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some buds
Daddy, I got what you need, you a sexy lil thug
Don't wanna be yo girl, I ain't lookin' for no love
So come give me a hug, you a sexy lil thug
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some buds
Daddy, I got what you need, you a sexy lil thug
Don't wanna be yo girl, I ain't lookin' for no love
So come give me a hug, you a sexy lil thug

Si Yo Fuera Un Chico," 
Si yo fuera un chico
Solo por una vez
Yo me vestiría como quiero
Con lo que vea primero y me voy
Saldría a buscar
Chicas por montón
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van a acompañarme hasta el fin
Cada noche a mentir
Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quién se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó
Si yo fuera un chico
Pero ves no lo soy
Los chicos son de molde
Y nosotras somos de corazón
Se piensan que son
Los del sexo superior
Pero cuando lo queremos
Los vence nuestra seducción, seducción
Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quién se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó
Es muy tarde ya ves para regresar
Perdonarte otra vez
Ya no lo vas a lograr
El lugar que ocupabas
Tú, ya no está más
Pero eres un chico, que le vas a hacer
No puedes comprender
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar
No te importa el dolor
Hasta que pierdes a quién quieres
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y queda sin saber que pasó
Pero eres un chico

Slow Love," 
I read all of the magazines
While waiting around
You said you couldn't wait to see me
But you got stuck in town
So turn off the phone
Now we're finally alone
It's the moments at the end of the day
Feel you touch and it's the sweetest
Your kisses are my weakness
I never want them to go away
[Chorus:]
I wanna feel you in my heart
As I look into your eyes
No need to get busy so let's take our time
And make slow love, slow love
And every minute that we have
It goes too fast
Wanna show you how to rock it so this feeling lasts
And make slow love, slow love
Slow love, slow love, slow love all night
[Verse 2:]
Just a few little things
That you've gotta know
A girl will give you all of her heart
When it's happening slow
I need a little laughter
And love will follow after
Let's take this chance to steal away
Your kisses are delicious
And no one is gonna miss us
Tonight I really want you to stay
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
So I'm calling out
Do you hear my cries
Don't have to say good-bye
You the breath on my skin
Cherish the taste
It's far too good to go to waste
Feel my desire
Make sweet love all through
All through the night
Make love through the night

Smash Into You," 
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut, I find myself in love racing the earth
And I soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run (run) smash into you
I wanna run (run) smash into you
Ears closed
What I hear no one else has to know
'Cause I know that what we have
Is worth first place and gold
And I soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run (run) smash into you
I wanna run (run) smash into you
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns
Hitting the ground
I should

And me and you belong
I wanna run smash into you

So Amazing," 
Love has truly been good to me 
Not even one sad day 
Or minute have I had since you've come my way 
I hope you know I'd gladly go 
Anywhere you'd take me

I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above 
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...I'd go

So Much Damn Swag (Interlude) [Homecoming Live]," 
I grew up in Houston, Texas visiting Prairie View
We rehearsed at TSU for many years in Third Ward
And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU
My college was Destiny's Child
My college was traveling around the world and life was my teacher
I wanted a Black orchestra. I wanted the steppers
I needed the vocalists
'Cause I wanted different characters—I didn't want us all doing the same thing
And the amount of swag is just limitless
Like, the things that these young people can do with their bodies
And the music they can play and the drumrolls
And the haircuts and the bodies and the—
It's just not right
It's just so much damn swag

To wear a pair of socks with the heels
And I look crazy but it does help pad your feet

Somewhere Over The Rainbow," 
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby ii ii iii
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true ooh ooooh
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me ee ee eeh
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops thats where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
And the dream that you dare to,why, oh why can't I?
Well I see trees of green and
Red roses too,
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day
I like the dark and I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying, I...I love you
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,
They'll learn much more
Than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world (w)oohoorld
Someday I'll wish upon a star,
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top that's where you'll find me
Oh, Somewhere over the rainbow way up high

Stand Up For Love," 
There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own
And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going
on?
When every second, every minute another soul is gone?
And I believe that in my life I will see an end to
hopelessness, of giving up, of suffering
CHORUS
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love
I'm inspired and hopeful each and everyday
That's how I know that things are gonna change
So how can I pretend that I don't know what's going
on?
When every second, with every minute another soul is
gone?
And I believe that in my life I will see(I will see

An end to hopelessness(Hopelessness), of giving
up(Giving Up), of suffering
CHORUS
If we all stand together this one time(Time)
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up for love
And it all starts right here
And it starts right now
One person stands up and the rest will follow
For all the forgotten, for all the unloved
I'm gonna sing this song
And I believe... 
...that in my life I will see an end to hopelessness,
of giving up, of suffering
CHORUS
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and sing

Start Over," 
I feel weak
We've been here before
'Cause I feel we
Keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over
Maybe we're through
But I honestly can say
I still love you
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find
Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life
I can see
That we're not happy here
So why would we
Keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it
Well, I don't
Maybe you'll settle
Well, I won't
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find
Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life
I know that this will hurt you
I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish
But that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us
Let's start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over
I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life

Stay," 
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air and said show me something
He said, if you dare come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay
Ohhh the reason I hold on
Ohhh cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ohhh

Stop Sign," 
I like to feel so high and
you feel good feeling low
I like my colours vivid
and you paint your colors gone
I like to see the world
and you like your week in tone
but I've been staying behind
while you refused to go
(Chorus)
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight off of my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old ""Stop"" sign
At that old ""Stop"" sign
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes owed
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me
and doing the same
(Chorus)
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old ""Stop"" sign
At that old ""Stop"" sign
I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lost you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
'Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
only to find you
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind
while you refused to go
(Chorus)
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old ""Stop"" sign
At that old ""Stop"" sign

Summertime," 
Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
Your were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the 4th day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man
I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime 
When we fell in love ot was the summertime 
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime 
Baby there is nothing like the summertime
Summertime
Now it's been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you
A little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family
Baby you're more than just a man
You are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby there is nothing like the summertime
Summertime
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby there is nothing like the summertime
Summertime

Yeah .. uh huh

That's real nice and all that
It's been, it been good though
Cause it's been a year

Cause it been so good
In the summertime all over again
Tell me somethin
[Beyonce]
Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
[Break - Beyonce - w/ ad libs]
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to
Someone who'll really listen
When you touched my hand
The sun got brighter then
Trusting you I close my eyes
And felt our love begin

I wanna understand everything you talk about baby
That's my word, cause I feel the same way
You know what I mean?
I've been feelin this way for a long time too
And a .. it's like I wanna be a daddy
I wanna be your lover
Your everything, I just wanna share life with you
Just like yo
That's why I tell you I love you
[Ghostface Killah]
I use to sit back and analyze on how we first met
A year ago on the barbershop steps
You and your friends walked past me
I called you back like ""come here sexy have a word with you yet,
please?""
Congratulations on bein my gift
God wrapped you up tight and he preserved my wish
I'm not a psychic it's just that I'm in tune with such
I swear the vibes got heavy when we got real close
My whole demeanor caused me to ask questions and stare at you
strangely
Have I found my baby?
If so then tell me now
Look like you was 'bout to say somethin, you just broke a smile
Gave you the number and I said I'd dial (yeah)
A year later we on the block like ""bow""
Tell me somethin, is it me or we up to somethin?
Love to love ya, your my friend and my woman
[Chorus]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime
[Ghostface Killah - talking]
This is Theodore, that's right
I keep hearin this all in my head over and over
I can't get it out, it's crazy
You know what I'm sayin baby
This joint is real, I like that
Tell me somethin
[Chorus]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)

Decided to dip, but now you wanna trip
Cuz another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, you're up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Cried my tears, three good years
Ya can't be mad at me
Cuz if you liked it

Don't be mad once you see that he want it

Remember those walls I built
Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere we're looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
Can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
Can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo
Can feel your halo, halo, halo
Can see your halo, halo, halo

Superpower (feat. Frank Ocean)," 
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show ya
I guess I didn't see myself before ya
Moving forward
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love

Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love
And I thought the world would revolve
(I thought the world would revolve)
Without us
(Without us, without us, without us)
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
And just like you, I can't be scared
And just like you, I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
A tough love
(Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky and what falls
It's the superpower
(Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we've got plenty super power

A tough love

Oh, like a shark

Ooh, too much to bear

Yes, we can

Turn the lights on!
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your sky
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

Can be sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

To wrap your arms around me for real

Temptations," 
(Chorus 4x) 
I know you see me watching you 
And I see you watching me 
Cuz boy your body's callin' 
The temptation is killin' me 
I'm chillin' at the spot and my posse's 4 deep 
Had my man on my mind, turn my head, what did I see 
The fellas lookin' fly, there was one that caught my
eye 
So I bit my lip, switched my hips as I walked by 
Sayin' ""Sexy boy, you so fly 
I just might give you a try 
I'ma write yo' number in the palm of my hand 
Oops, I forgot I got a man"" 
(Chorus 4x) 
I'm thinkin' to myself, should I even take the chance?
Should I do what's on my mind or should I stay down
with my man? 
This boy here got me fiendin' and I'm wantin' him so
bad 
Should I chill when I'm with him 
and risk everything I have 
Saying ""Sexy boy, you so fly 
I wish I could give you a try 
But my man's at home waiting for me by the phone 
Sorry, can't get my groove on""

This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like, for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos & the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty

The Way We Were,"

Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me - Would we? Could we?
Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were

Estou no meu local preferido do mundo agora, ou seja, na minha casa.
Estou muito empolgada, pois farei uma turnê mundial e também por causa deste show. Mal posso esperar para mostrá-lo.
Ao mesmo tempo, adoro minha casa e sei que sentirei falta dela. Então, é melhor eu dormir como um bebê esta noite porque, amanhã, serei Sasha Fierce, e será impossível voltar atrás.
Mas como ficarei fora por tanto tempo é melhor começar a ser Sasha Fierce está noite.

Everyone’s feeling pretty
It’s hotter than july
Though the world’s full of problems
They couldn’t touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley’s hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block
Didn’t know you
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’, jam on
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip way
Peace has come to zimbabwe
Third world’s right on the one
Now’s the time for celebration
‘Cause we’ve only just begun
Didn’t know you
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn
Didn’t know you
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn
Would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’
Would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’, jam on
People keep on learnin’
Soldiers keep on warrin’
World
Keep on turnin’
‘Cause it won’t to be too long
Powers keep on lyin’
While your people keep on dyin’
World keep on turnin’
‘Cause it won’t be too long
I’m so darn glad he let me try it again
‘Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I’m so glad that I know more than I knew then
Keep on tryin’ till I reach my highest ground
I’m so darn glad he let me try it again
‘Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I’m so glad that I know more than I knew then
Keep on tryin’ till I reach my highest ground

I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me

Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
And I'ma help you build up your account

I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me

I'll be the help, whenever you need me (you need me)

They call shots, I call audibles

It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow (hey), now look at the time (hey) I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me, wow

USA National Anthem," 
Oh, say can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh say does that star-
Spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
The brave

VMA 2014 Medley," 
I been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine
Oh, mine, oh, mine, oh, mine
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since then, baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are
We're taking this a little too far
With me being where ever I'm at
Worrying about where ever you are
We're taking this a little too far
On my mind, I pass my bed time
No rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this
And let's get carried away
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now you know where I stay
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard you're mine, you're mine

What's your aspiration in life?
To be happy
It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
t's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You want me?
I want it done my way
You like it?
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay
Ride around, ride around in that action
Those candles in your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First go through my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true
Baby, put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
""Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no, no, no""
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me
If you keep me your promise, I'm keeping mine, hey
Must be good to you

We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller

You should aim to be successful but not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man""

Brille sans fin
Tout au bout du chemin
Vite oubliés effacés
Une lumière dorée 
Brille sans fin
Sens au coeur de la nuit
L'onde d'espoir
Ardeur de la vie
Sentier de gloire
Ardeur de la vie 
De la vie
Sentier de gloire

Wake Up," 
I don't wanna wake, wake
Excuse me? Um, I love you
Who starts a conversation like that? Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up or hide you
I'll get you out my mind, hmm, I try to
Why you? In my dreams, I knew
You knew how to be there, you knew how to treat it
You knew how to keep it, I wanna do more than touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you up to
We can leave right now, nigga, you don't need a duffle
La perla, provocateur of secrets
How is it a secret if I know you're gonna peep it?
I see you peeking, don't wanna hear a peep
Wait
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
You're such a dream
If you can believe?
Boy, you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah
Hey there, boy, I love you
I'm feeling like I know you, I can't help but wanna thug you
I'm watching all these broads trying so damn hard
But I can't even blame 'em', cause you're so irresistible
I want to stand and yell, I won't ever dare to tell
I think I heard some wedding bells (keep that to yourself)
Is this real?
Ooh child, I can stop praying now
Past life, let's rewind
To the day when I met you
Throwback
Dear God, how could I forget you?
Your sex
Boy, it feels just like a dream to me
Now
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh

Walk On Water (part. Eminem)," 
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)
Why our expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark’s high
Butterflies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
’Til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like: this shit is garbage
God’s given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try to not listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes
’Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations
And meet 'em, but first, the Speedom verse
Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast
Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground
And all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown
'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it

We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life

When I First Saw You (feat. Jamie Foxx)," 
When I first saw you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
When it all seemed to go bad
Then I find you
And I have had the most beautiful dream
Any man's ever had
When I first say you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
To make me strong
You were the only
Reason I had to go on
You were my dream
All the things that I'll ever knew
You were my dream
Who could believe they would ever come true
And who could believe
The world would believe
In my dreams too
Before, you appeared
Life was only a game
And day in
And day out
Were the same, oh
Now a dream
Coming true
Like a star
See it shine
A dream
That is yours
That is mine
You were my dream
Now I got dreams of my own
Dreams you'll never know
You won't take my dream from me
When I first saw you
I said oh my
I said oh my
That's my dream

Wishing On a Star," 
Star...
I'm wishing... wishing... wishing on a star...
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow, praying it'll comes
And I'm wishing on the other things we've ever done
I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we spent
I just can't let you go, for me you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
(so-o-o-o-w)
I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby
When we're together, whether or never
I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby
When we're together (let's get together, baby),
whether or never
I'm wishing on a star (wishing on a star)
To follow where you are (to follow where you are)
I'm wishing on a dream (wishing on a dream)
To follow what it means (to follow what it means)
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
I'm hoping on the days to come and days to go
I'm hoping on the days of loving, loving you so
Baby, Forgive me
Let's make up, I'm sorry
Let's be together, break up? Never
The love we have has been special so far
Till we get back from wishing on a star

Yes," 
I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me

But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes
I said yes we can be together
Yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes
You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin me baby
I was watchin you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you 
You ask me where I'm from 
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So I gave my number to you
I said yes you number
And yes to you datin me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no 
It's like I never said yes

I want to get to know you more

No baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset
Boy you act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful
You was at my house
I was sittin' on my couch
You was really beggin' 
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move to slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It's cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
Cuz you show me your true face baby

Young Forever," 
Eternamente Jovem
Vamos dançar com elegância, vamos dançar por um instante.
O paraíso pode esperar, estamos apenas observando os céus.
Desejando o melhor, mas esperando o pior.
Você vai deixar cair a bomba ou não?
Deixem-nos morrer jovens ou deixem-nos viver eternamente.
Nós não temos o poder, mas nunca dizemos ""nunca"".
Sentando num fosso de areia, a vida é uma viagem curta.
A música é para os homens tristes...
Você consegue imaginar quando esta corrida estiver ganha?
Transformamos nossos rostos dourados no sol,
Louvando nossos líderes, estamos entrando em sintonia.
A música é tocada pelos homens loucos...
Eternamente jovem, eu quero ser eternamente jovem.
Você realmente quer viver eternamente?
Eternamente e sempre?
Eternamente jovem, eu quero ser eternamente jovem.
Você realmente quer viver eternamente?
Eternamente jovem
Alguns são como água, alguns são como o calor,
Alguns são uma melodia e alguns são o rítmo.
Cedo ou tarde, todos eles estarão mortos.
Por que eles não permanecem jovens?
É tão difícil ficar velho sem um motivo,
Eu não quero perecer como um cavalo moribundo.
A juventude é como diamantes ao sol,
E diamantes são para sempre...
Tantas aventuras não poderiam acontecer hoje,
Tantas canções que esquecemos de tocar,
Tantos sonhos arrumando-se de repente,
Nós vamos deixá-los tornar-se realidade.
Eternamente jovem, eu quero ser eternamente jovem.
Você realmente quer viver eternamente?
Eternamente e sempre?
Eternamente jovem, eu quero ser eternamente jovem.
Você realmente quer viver eternamente?
Eternamente jovem
Eternamente jovem, eu quero ser eternamente jovem.
Você realmente quer viver eternamente?
